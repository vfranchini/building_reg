## Overview of regulatory process
Building and land use regulation has been key to successful disaster risk reduction and hazard adaptation in the developed world. Tools for reducing disaster risk and adapting to hazards have been constructed on the foundation of regulatory measures originally established to deal with chronic urban risks related to fire, structural safety, and public health. Over the past century, advances in natural science and engineering have provided the basis for regulation to reduce larger-scale disaster risk.
In the past 10 years, high-income countries with mature building control mechanisms have experienced 47 percent of disasters globally, but they have accounted for only 7 percent of disaster fatalities.75  The smaller share of human losses in high-income countries is correlated with better regulatory implementation and compliance to address chronic and acute risks in construction. 
Recent reviews of the progress under the HFA have indicated that while developing countries have improved their legislative frameworks for disaster risk reduction, serious challenges remain in implementing effective building regulatory regimes to improve resilience at the municipal and local levels.
The continuing failure of regulatory implementation in low- and middle-income countries has significantly increased disaster risks. This report argues that achieving an effective regulatory framework in developing countries requires a broad participation of technical, financial, and social stakeholders and must take into account the reality on the ground. Implementing good practice should follow a flexible and incremental process consistent with the level of understanding, skills, and income of the various target groups involved in construction. 
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the core institutional components of a functioning building regulatory regime. The components and practices described in this chapter are typical of mature regulatory systems that have evolved over an extended period of industrialization and urbanization. 
### Key components of an effective building regulatory regime
Three basic components form the core of any building code regulatory regime:
+ .A legal and administrative framework at the national level;
+ .A building code development and maintenance process; and
+ .Implementation of building and land use regulation at the local level.
///A legal and administrative framework at the national level./// This framework includes the institutions that deliver enabling legislation for the establishment and enforcement of land use and building regulations, including dispute resolution mechanisms. In a broader sense, this component also includes other enabling legislation that supports materials testing and certifications of building professionals and organizations. In higher-income settings, this capacity typically extends to legislation on professional liability and insurance mechanisms. In some cases, and as a result of constitutional arrangements, enabling legislation for building regulation can be organized at the subnational level. 
///A building code development and maintenance process./// This process is essential to set minimum requirements for safe construction of new buildings and retrofit of existing buildings.  An open participatory process with representation from all relevant stakeholders is necessary to ensure regulations that represent the values and resources of the relevant community. How a building code is developed and updated (and how stakeholders are consulted in the process) critically determines if a code is feasible in the local context and serves as an effective and affordable tool for risk reduction.
Building code development is usually a process led by authorities at a central level yet typically involves both central and local stakeholders. It is important that codes be developed with reference to local practice and locally available materials and that they allow for innovation and improvement in construction practice. Codes provide an important means to communicate new knowledge to practice. The code development process must enjoy the confidence and understanding of the building sector and the general public.
Oftentimes code development involves a central body that has the capacity to develop a model code. This is then adopted by authorities at the central level or subnational level (state), which has responsibility for local legislation and implementation. These bodies also provide the mechanism for code maintenance and updating. Many codes are model documents developed at a higher level of authority than is responsible for enforcement. But the level responsible for implementation and enforcement is also involved in regulatory development and consultation. Uniform building code provisions at the state or national level contribute to compliance by designers and builders as well as regulatory authorities. To be effective in risk reduction, building codes must be mandatory, and compliance must be feasible. 
///Implementation of building and land use regulation./// Implementation is essential to the actual reduction of risks. Building regulation implementation includes primary activities of preconstruction plan review, on-site building inspection, and permitting. These activities involve direct interaction with building designers and builders and ensure compliance with promulgated code requirements. This chapter will describe key practices within compliance strategies that seek to improve quality and compliance with basic standards of safety. Building code implementation is, in most cases, a function of the local or municipal government.
### Regulatory ecology: The interdependent institutional context
As used here, “regulatory ecology” refers to the context of the regulatory process within a range of complex interdependent and evolving institutions.
The core components of a building and land use regulatory framework clearly do not function in a vacuum. In the developed world, regulatory capacity has evolved in parallel with a complex mix of supporting tools and institutions that have provided legal and financial mechanisms, as well as certified technical competence, required to deliver regulatory services. Key elements of this regulatory ecology include the general conditions for commercial development, such as rule of law, security of tenure, and functioning building finance and insurance mechanisms. 
Important institutions specific to the building sector include accredited building professional education, professional societies and related codes of practice, accredited training institutions for the construction labor force, licensing procedures for building professionals, and quality control processes for building materials. 
This chapter focuses on the code development, maintenance, and implementation processes.
