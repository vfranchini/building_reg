## Key components of a building regulatory process
The generic components of a building regulatory regime described above are essential to the reduction of disaster and chronic risk in the built environment. In many low-income countries, these core components do not exist or are highly dysfunctional. In many middle-income countries, these components may formally exist but remain inefficient and ineffective. As a result, risk continues to expand through unsafe construction on unsafe sites. 
The specific configuration and location of these components as well as the distribution of responsibility between national and local government and the private sector will vary from country to country. In middle-income countries, the institutions of the regulatory ecology may exist but may not adequately support a robust regulatory function. In low-income countries, the institutions of the regulatory ecology may be absent or largely dysfunctional.
### Legal and administrative capacity 
The legislative foundation for a building and land use framework is typically established at the national level. Most countries have basic laws that establish public responsibility to both regulate buildings and establish principles for local implementation and enforcement.
Beyond this basic legislation, a robust legal and administrative component at the national level will typically include the following elements:
+ .Comprehensive building codes for engineered structures and appropriate guidance on non-engineered construction for builders and owners.
+ .Programs to institutionalize a regulatory implementation at the local level, particularly in rapidly expanding urban areas. This requires allocation of resources to train and maintain qualified staff in local governments as well as the promotion of regulatory governance, including transparency and accountability.
+ .Initiatives to continuously inform, educate, and collaborate with local governments and municipal authorities implementing building and land use regulations.
+ .Initiatives to support hazard mapping and risk assessment, to evaluate building performance and encourage innovation, to support education and training for building professionals and construction trades, and to support public understanding of the health and safety benefits of regulatory compliance. 
+ .Establishment of minimum qualifications for building professionals, including engineers, architects, planners, contractors, and building officials. Requirements for professional competency are key to improving the quality and safety of construction.
### Code development and maintenance
Building codes are at the heart of the building regulatory regime. Building codes translate societal values related to public health, safety, and general welfare into specific requirements in prescriptive or performance terms. 
Codes establish minimum physical standards for the design, construction, maintenance, and renovation of buildings. Codes communicate both social and technical values (including implicitly acceptable risk) and serve as a mechanism to introduce new social and technical understanding into building practice. As such, building codes provide a common script for building professionals, owners, and regulators. There have been efforts to introduce developed-country building codes into low- and middle-income countries, but these have met with limited success.
### Characteristics of effective codes
Experience has indicated that there are several basic characteristics of effective codes:
+ .///Participatory development process:///
The code development process should provide for open participation from the full range of interested stakeholders, including building professionals, developers, and materials manufacturers, as well as representatives of the finance, commercial, and social services sectors. The development of code provisions integrates judgments of acceptable risk and affordability.  The process should be based on broad societal consensus. It must also be inclusive of the range of relevant building practices, including the non-engineered construction of the informal sector in addition to sophisticated engineered structures. An open, consensus-based code development process significantly increases acceptance and compliance by the building sector. 
+ .///Comprehensive and inclusive of all aspects of the projects:///
Building and land use regulation were initially developed to deal with a range of chronic hazards including fire, structural collapse, epidemic disease, and public health. In the past century, building codes and land use management have been developed as mitigation or risk reduction measures for natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, and extreme wind events.
Particularly in urban areas, it is important that building codes address, in an integrated manner, the basic issues of structural integrity; fire safety; electrical, plumbing, and mechanical systems; and resource efficiency. These aspects of building function immediately benefit building occupants and are as important as disaster risk reduction.
+ .///Affordability and risk tradeoff:///
Recognizing the tradeoff of safety and affordability, feasible codes must aspire to provide the highest level of amenity and safety that can be achieved with available resources. Unrealistic standards often have the effect of pushing builders into the informal sector, so that the benefits of health and safety regulation are lost. Authorities need to strike the right balance between these competing interests and seek a sustainable compromise through a transparent consultation of a broad range of stakeholders.
Given that the tradeoff between risk and affordability is embedded in code provisions, it is unrealistic to simply transfer codes from one society to another. Judgment of acceptable risk for building failure due to natural hazards is subject to several variables, including the perception of other potential investments in the reduction of other risks or in additional opportunities for social and economic development.
+ .///Risk-based code development:///
Risk or potential loss is a function of three components: hazard exposure, structure vulnerability, and societal consequences of failure.<sup>76</sup> Risk can be lessened by the reduction of any or all of these three components.
+ .+ .**Hazard exposure**, usually represented by a reference hazard map
+ .+ .**Potential structural failure under expected hazard loads**, which is the primary concern of the technical provisions of the building code
+ .+ .**Social consequences of structural failure**, which are represented by importance factors based on the building function and occupancy. 
Although the technical provisions of the building code address acceptable structural performance, the external considerations of hazard environment and social consequences are included in the code in these two ways:
///Hazard mapping for building codes./// The building code specifically addresses the reduction of potential structural failure or irreparable damage. The component of risk represented by natural hazard is typically introduced to the code by a hazard map that differentiates zones of expected hazard impact. Risk maps are available for seismic, flood, coastal storm surge, wind, snow load, and landslide hazards.
Building requirements vary according to estimated expected loads. Adequate hazard mapping for reference in building code forms an integral part of the regulatory regime for disaster risk reduction. However, these maps are only of value to the extent that they are applied through code implementation and compliance. 
///Occupancy type and post-disaster buildings./// Another aspect of risk that building codes address is the consequence of failure of specific structures and occupancy types. Codes typically assign importance factors to specific occupancy classes such as hospitals, schools, fire stations, places of assembly, and so on. 
These factors relate to the importance of the facility in the post-disaster period and to the vulnerability of the occupants. Based on the importance factor, building provisions may be increased over normal construction to further reduce the likelihood of failure. This reference to risk of hazard impact and to occupancy importance allows the design, construction, and inspection resources to focus on the areas and structures of greatest concern for society. This prioritization of resources is particularly important in low- and middle-income countries.
+ .///Performance-based codes:///
Building regulations are typically prescriptive; they specifically describe and require the design solution that meets the standard. Prescriptive codes are assumed to meet the intended safety standard and can be easily observed and measured to assure compliance. Prescriptive codes are relatively straightforward and amenable to review and inspection—but they are also restrictive and may inhibit innovation in design and construction. 
In response to this limitation, developed countries are moving toward use of performance codes. Performance codes define the performance objective rather than the specific solution. This means that any solution that meets the performance requirement can be deemed to conform to code. 
This flexibility is important to facilitate introduction of new designs, materials, and construction techniques that can meet safety standards more efficiently and cost -effectively. In low- and middle-income countries, the performance approach may be relevant as a means of recognizing the potential of indigenous building techniques and materials. To the extent that traditional building types can be demonstrated to provide required performance, they can be considered in compliance. This flexibility may be important as an opportunity to improve safety using local materials and building traditions. However, the performance approach requires considerable technical sophistication on the part of designers, builders, and regulators.
+ .///Code accessibility:///
Code documents should be clear and unambiguous. They should provide adequate guidance to designers and builders to facilitate compliance. Simple and unambiguous code provisions increase the efficiency of compliance, review, and inspection while reducing potential conflicts of interpretation.
Codes should be designed and presented in terms appropriate for the user audiences. Sophisticated modern structures designed by professional architects and engineers might require technically complex provisions, while simpler forms of construction using traditional indigenous materials and techniques should be accessible to builders with less advanced technical training.
+ .///Periodic code review and updating:///
Code documents must be subject to review and updating on a regular basis on a three- to five-year cycle. This regular updating is important as an opportunity to incorporate new knowledge related to experience of building performance and innovations in construction materials and practice. It is also important as a means to adjust to dynamically evolving social and economic conditions in developing countries.

#### Key takeaway
The characteristics of effective building codes are as follows:
+ .They are developed through an open and participatory process that ensures deep and broad expertise as well as a strong buy-in from communities and building practitioners.
+ .The standards they set are affordable and consistent with local income levels and resources.
+ .The risk reduction and mitigation measures are consistent with local skills and capabilities.
+ .They encompass non-engineered forms of construction to support gradual improvements in quality and safety.
+ .They establish a proportional response to risk through reference to hazard mapping and prioritization of building occupancies.
+ .They allow for alternative compliance solutions to support innovations or traditional building practices that meet minimum safety requirements.
+ .They are accessible, clear, and understandable for building practitioners.
+ .They are regularly updated to reflect incremental progress in surrounding circumstances such as skills development, new technologies and building materials, emerging risks, and evolving income levels.

### Compliance support oriented by plan review, site inspections, and permitting
A typical building code compliance system includes a capacity for building plan reviews, building site inspections, and a permitting mechanism. 
For new construction, there are five steps that will guarantee compliance with relevant building standards.
This section briefly describes these five steps and the practices that form the foundations of their effective and efficient implementation.
#### Five generic steps for building compliance assurance
**Submission of a building application to the local authority**. This process usually requires the applicant to disclose information about who will perform the work, what work will be done, where the building will be located, and how it will be built. Sketches, building plans, proof of land rights, and any other relevant documentation of the proposed work must be submitted for review.
**Review process by the local authority**.  The building official, or an accredited third-party plan reviewer, determines the project’s compliance.  This includes evaluating if it adheres to local planning and land use requirements and construction codes as well as if it meets other requirements set by other public agencies. The reviewing authority or accredited agent is expected to have the basic technical capacity to carry out compliance checks at the design stage.   
**Issuance of the building permit**.  When compliance with code, zoning, and other applicable regulations is confirmed, the local authority approves the application and issues the permit. A fee is usually collected to cover municipal costs associated with the time spent by the building official in the application process, the technical review of plans, and the various on-site inspections.
**Inspection of construction**. Each major phase of construction can be inspected by the municipality engineers or their private accredited agents in order to make certain that the work conforms to the code, the building permit, and the approved building plans. In New Zealand, the building code for most building types mandates no fewer than seven standard inspections. In other jurisdictions, the decision to carry out an inspection is determined by a risk analysis that includes several criteria, such as the track record of the builder, the type of construction or design, the characteristics of the site, and other factors relevant to a municipal risk assessment. A number of states in Australia and regions in the U.K. follow this approach. They rely on relatively advanced information systems and means of data collection that are not necessarily available in all circumstances.
**Issuance of the occupancy permit**. Many jurisdictions mandate the issuance of occupancy permits following a successful final inspection. The occupancy permit confirms compliance with code requirements, conditions for insurance and financing, and builder liability.  Local building authorities usually issue a certificate of occupancy in consultation with other public agencies. 
#### Five principles of code governance for effective risk management
**Transparency in building code administration** allows for the effective disclosure of critical information on building regulations.  This in turn gives building practitioners and owners the tools to both comply with regulations and reduce excessive discretion and compliance costs.**
**Process efficiency for building permits and inspections minimizes the bureaucracy around building controls as well as reduces the time, number of procedures, and transaction costs needed to gain the necessary approvals.
**Utilization of private sector third-party engineering consultants**—the practice of contracting out regulatory reviews and inspections to certified engineers—supports building code implementation by expanding regulatory capacity in terms of manpower and technical expertise.
**Risk-based implementation** ensures a targeted use of code review and inspection capacity on structures that pose higher risks for their occupants and the community.
**Conflict resolution mechanisms** provide remedies for persons or firms that can be adversely affected by permitting authorities.
///Transparency in building code administration///
At the code development stage, transparency means that interested parties have the opportunity to participate in an open consultative process oriented toward consensus.
At the implementation stage, transparency means that owners and builders who must comply with regulation have access to the regulation and can readily understand its requirements.
Practically defined, a commitment to transparency is typically reflected by
+ .Making land use plans available to all citizens and placing them online. 
+ .Developing process maps or guidelines for the entire construction permitting process.
+ .Providing clear guidelines on complete construction permit application requirements.
Enhanced transparency can draw attention to corrupt and opaque regulation or practices and shed light on inefficiencies, thereby encouraging reform and modernization.  A commitment to transparency involves disclosing easy-to-access, clear, and accurate information. When applied to building code implementation, transparency is considerably enhanced through the following generic practices.
#### Components of transparency in building code implementation:
+ .Available guidelines and checklists covering requirements from all regulatory agencies with different mandates
+ .Regulations in plain language
+ .Regulations supported by user-friendly construction guides with illustrations and examples
+ .Requirements for “complete permit applications” that are clearly defined
+ .Construction permit application forms that use plain language and are standardized
+ .Permit applications and associated documentation and plans that can be submitted electronically
+ .Application status and location available to track online

///Process efficiency and low transaction costs for building permits and inspections///
Added costs of code compliance are largely a consequence of increased design requirements included in technical standards referenced by building codes. 
Regulatory process costs, which cover review, inspection, and approval processes, include
+ .+ .Formal fees imposed by approval authorities, and
+ .+ .“Opportunity costs” associated with complex, lengthy permitting procedures and the resulting delays in making the building available for its final intended use. 
Since 2014, __Doing Business__ has measured the cost of land use, building permitting, and inspections as a percentage of the total investment cost in the building. The report found that this cost is on average only 1.7 percent in OECD countries and rarely exceeds 3 percent in countries with advanced building code systems associated with a high degree of regulatory compliance. For example, as measured by Doing Business 2014, the cost of regulatory compliance in Japan, New Zealand, and Chile was less than 0.7 percent in each country.<sup>77</sup> 
Maintaining transactions costs of building code implementation below the above thresholds is associated with permanent or institutionalized practices, including 
+ .**A transparent regulatory system**. Easy access to accurate and clear information on regulatory requirements from various approval agencies and building code officials will reduce opportunity costs typically experienced with more complex and opaque procedures.
+ .**A continuous, institutionalized process of streamlining and modernizing permitting and inspections procedures**. In many jurisdictions, the legislation specifically requires compliance with a wide array of other laws related to environmental standards, land use planning, national heritage, and so on, in addition to building code requirements. Streamlining the procedures and placing them online can contribute, on average, to a reduction of 37 percent of the time required to issue a building permit, according to the U.S. Center for Digital Government.
+ .**The “one-stop-shop” role of the main building code official or “chief building” official**. In best-practice jurisdictions, chief building officers are not only responsible for confirming compliance with regulations administered by the municipal building authority; they are also empowered to confirm compliance with other agency requirements or other “applicable laws.”78  Given the extent to which building officials rely on information from other applicable law agencies to assess and confirm compliance, other agencies should demonstrate that they are transparent with respect to their requirements and decision-making criteria.
+ .**Time frames for the review of building permit applications**. In conjunction with greater transparency, time frames for permit reviews help to limit corruption and increase efficiency. Time frames typically vary according to the complexity of the application.
+ .**Fee levels that are based on cost recovery**. Fees should be based on the actual costs associated with the review of building plans and site inspection, including overhead costs. Appropriate fees charged for construction permitting and building inspection are intended to cover the costs of regulatory services and not to subsidize other municipal functions. 

#### Key takeaway
Practices that enable efficient implementation procedures with lower compliance costs include
+ .Transparent and easy access to maps and regulatory information for applicants and chief building officials.
+ .Streamlined permitting and inspections procedures combined with ICT solutions.
+ .Chief building official’s comprehensive role.
+ .Established time frames for the review of building permit applications.
+ .Fee levels that are based on cost recovery and do not fulfill a property tax purpose.

///Utilization of private sector in compliance checks///
Private engineering and architectural firms certified by the public building regulatory department provide third-party reviews. Reviews and inspections are carried out by professionals who have been certified in specific areas of competency. 
Third-party review and inspection is particularly valuable as it effectively expands both the quantity and quality of regulatory manpower. Special inspections for highly specialized buildings or building components can also be carried out by independent inspectors to supplement the technical capacity of building department staff.
Over the past 20 years, a stronger focus on risks has been associated with a parallel effort to seek a significantly larger role for private sector expertise in regulatory compliance strategies. This has offered a source of innovative experience in building control, with useful experience emerging in high-income countries, transitional economies, and middle-income countries. 
This consistent trend across countries is such that the use of the private sector in compliance checks is already institutionalized in countries as diverse as Colombia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Russia, and the Philippines. Driving this shift is the realization that building code implementation can be maximized by adding external resources and critical capacity to resource-constrained municipalities.   
Private sector participation in building controls can follow different models of collaboration. It can consist of private sector engineers being delegated by local authorities to carry out third-party plan reviews and inspections (as in Germany and Austria). Alternatively, builders in some jurisdictions can directly retain approved private independent engineers to review construction plans and inspect buildings during construction (as in the United Kingdom).  
The latter model involves builders directly hiring a private accredited inspection firm. In the United Kingdom, Approved Inspectors are registered and supervised by an autonomous body. Approved Inspectors typically review and inspect all aspects of construction. They can inspect work, and issue plan certificates confirming that building plans comply with the building code, but only for the types of buildings for which they are approved and registered.
The third model is less widespread and is associated with an insurance-driven regulatory regime in which insurance and warranty firms engage private inspection firms for third-party review. This approach is in place in France and is being gradually implemented in Spain and Italy. It is relevant to upper-middle-income countries with a preexisting insurance market.
All three models point to innovative ways of bringing new expertise into risk reduction without necessarily relying solely on what may be limited municipal technical resources.
In Austria and Quebec, Canada, the utilization of private sector technical capacity relies more heavily on designer and contractor licensing with less emphasis on third-party audits by municipal or private inspectors. This approach provides an even greater opportunity to engage the private sector. This practice transfers a greater portion of compliance responsibility to the designer and builder.
#### Key takeaway
Private sector solutions for building code implementation
+ .Can help municipalities refocus on risks by bringing in relevant and more robust expertise.
+ .Can substantially alleviate the pressure on public enforcement.
+ .Are increasingly considered and tested in emerging economies and lower-income settings to deal with critical institutional bottlenecks.
+ .Must be supported by some institutional arrangements to ensure relevant qualifications, avoid conflicts of interest, and ensure minimal supervision by independent or state authorities.
+ .Follow different modalities and forms of collaboration that can be chosen based on the country or city circumstances.
///Risk-based implementation///
Allocating regulatory resources to maximize risk reduction provides a rational basis for efficiently and effectively prioritizing inspections in proportion to risk. This approach is particularly important for municipalities and building control agencies in developing countries that operate with limited funding and must deal with rapidly expanding building inventories.
The benefits of risk-based building permitting and inspections include
+ .Achieving a proportionate and consistent approach for plan review and inspection of buildings.
+ .Enabling local authorities to focus resources on higher-risk building projects.
+ .Providing authorities with opportunities for process simplification, specifically for construction that presents lower risk in the local context.
+ .Enabling authorities to focus on builders with a history of noncompliance.
+ .Shifting the risk, responsibility, and liability back to the design sector, in which private designers and engineers have the skills, competencies, and experience to function without controls or with limited controls.
+ .Reducing regulatory demands on builders responsible for construction projects placed in lower-risk categories.
+ .Contributing to lower cost of compliance, from the perspective of both regulators and those regulated.

///Applying risk management to construction permit and inspections///
As of 2014, the World Bank counted 88 countries that have, based on risk exposure, implemented simple and fast-track procedures for processing permits for commercial buildings of less than 1,000 square meters.<sup>79</sup> Most of these reforms were implemented in developing countries, often catalyzed by the publication of the __Doing Business__ report.<sup>80</sup> 
In a bold reform initiated in 2011, FYR Macedonia developed a risk-based system linking a new classification of buildings with building professional classes, allowing designers and contractors licensed in only the top qualification class to handle the more complex and higher-risk classes of buildings. Not only has this approach been instrumental in reducing state controls, but it has increased transparency and promoted more consistent implementation of building regulations.<sup>81</sup>  
Introducing risk-based mechanisms in construction permitting and inspections creates tangible opportunities to initiate more in-depth administrative simplification programs with the aim of using resources more selectively and reducing the administrative cost of compliance.
///Conflict resolution mechanisms///
Conflict resolution provides remedies for persons or firms that can be adversely affected by permitting authorities. These mechanisms promote transparency and a level playing field by addressing issues ranging from the interpretation of technical requirements, to sufficiency of building code design and compliance, to licensing of building professionals. Conflict and appeal mechanisms typically have a majority of legally qualified specialists presiding over them to ensure that due process is followed in a swift and efficient manner.
