## Conclusion
The core components and supporting institutions for a building and land use regulatory framework are fundamental to disaster and chronic risk reduction in new and existing settlements. They constitute the critical link between theoretical scientific understanding of hazards, engineering understanding of building performance, and the necessary change in building practice to reduce disaster risk.
Investments in hazard mapping and engineering mitigation measures have no impact on risk without implementation in building practice. To date, this link to practice has been missing in most low- and middle-income countries. Experience from developed countries has demonstrated the necessity of the three core components: 
1.. A legal and administrative framework
2.. Inclusive and locally appropriate code development, maintenance, and dissemination process
3.. Effective and efficient compliance support through plan review, site inspection, and permitting
Initial efforts in Nepal, Madagascar, Pakistan, and Turkey have demonstrated effective means to support the development of these core components and to advance the key supporting institutions.
Established building and land use regimes in developed countries have demonstrated success in reducing disaster and chronic risk, particularly in terms of life loss. Once established, the core components and supporting institutions will likely follow a locally defined evolutionary path of growth in capacity, as has been the case with regulatory capacity in developed countries.
