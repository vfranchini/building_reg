Self-regulation and accreditation of building regulatory agenciesThe International Accreditation Service (IAS) of the International Code Council provides an evaluation service for the accreditation of local building departments.  Evaluations are based on analysis of staff training and technical qualifications, plan review and site inspection practice, customer service, and administrative efficiency.  This accreditation process provides a valuable external review and evaluation of regulatory efficiency and effectiveness. The accreditation process informs the building department of areas of deficiency and provides a benchmark for quality of service. IAS accreditation is not only a credit to the municipal government; it also shows the business community and general public that the building department is functioning at a high level of competence and is worthy of support and cooperation. Public confidence in regulatory agencies is essential to code compliance. This service is provided by an independent, nongovernmental, nonprofit organization representing building departments and officials from across the country.
