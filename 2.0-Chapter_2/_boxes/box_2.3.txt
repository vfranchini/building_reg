Obtaining market acceptance of innovations through a performance-based building regulatory framework in South AfricaIn the 1940s and 1950s, applications for building approvals were governed largely by local by-laws in South Africa. By the 1960s, standard building regulations had been introduced and were intended to be applied nationally but were not appropriate for all situations and system-built state-funded housing encountered a number of challenges.Subsequently, the director of the National Building Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research persuaded the minister of Public Works, whose department was responsible for housing construction, that South Africa should adopt the French system for assessing and approving nonstandardized building and construction products and systems. This system established performance-based criteria against which the fitness-for-purpose of the product could be assessed. Thus, Agrément South Africa was established. Among other objectives, the authorities charged Agrément South Africa with facilitating the adoption of appropriate innovation in the industry.The South African regulatory system therefore incorporates both a prescriptive code as well as performance-based provisions that recognize more cost-effective and vernacular forms of construction.Source: Kraayenbrink 1999.
