Box 2.7.   Building code effectiveness and insurance

The Insurance Services Office (ISO) Building Code Effectiveness Grading Schedule (BCEGS) assesses building codes that are in effect in a particular community as well as how the community enforces its building codes. Special emphasis is placed on mitigation of losses from natural hazards.
The concept is simple: municipalities with well-enforced, up-to-date codes should demonstrate better loss experience, and insurance rates can reflect that. The prospect of lessening disaster-related damage and ultimately lowering insurance costs provides an incentive for communities to enforce their building codes rigorously—especially as they relate to windstorm and earthquake damage.
The anticipated consequences include safer buildings, less damage, and lower insured losses from disasters.
The BCEGS program assigns each municipality a BCEGS grade between 1 (exemplary commitment to building code enforcement) and 10. The ISO develops advisory rating credits that apply to ranges of BCEGS classifications (1–3, 4–7, 8–9, 10). The ISO gives insurers BCEGS classifications, advisory credits, and related underwriting information on which to base insurance premiums.
The program was first implemented in U.S. states with high exposure to wind (hurricane) hazards before it was expanded to states with high seismic exposure.
BCEGS is similar in concept to the ISO’s Public Protection Classification evaluations of municipal fire suppression capabilities that insurers in the United States have used for decades.
