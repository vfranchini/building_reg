This document is the executive summary of the World Bank publication “Building Regulation for Resilience”, released in October 2015. The publication focuses on how the building regulation process can be enhanced in order to save lives and reduce destruction from disaster and chronic risks. As part of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Reduction 2015-2030 agenda, the report calls upon the international community to act now to pursue more effective approaches to land use management and building regulation. To achieve this goal, it outlines an integrated, programmatic approach for building regulatory capacity, primarily in vulnerable low and middle-income countries.
