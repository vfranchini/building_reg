## Poor-quality construction as the main contributor to expanding disaster and chronic risk
Disaster risk is primarily the product of hazard exposure and vulnerable construction. In the 25 years since the initiation of the United Nations International Decade for Disaster Reduction (UNIDNDR 1990–2000), the expansion of disaster risk due to unsafe development has far outpaced efforts to contain or reduce it.
Over the past 20 years, disasters and natural hazards have affected 4.4 billion people, claimed 1.3 million lives, and caused $2 trillion in economic losses.<sup>11</sup> These disasters have disproportionately impacted the poor and the marginalized.
In terms of human lives lost, low- and low-to-middle income countries have suffered 85 percent of total global disaster-related fatalities.<sup>12</sup>  A report funded by the  Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) shows that disasters’ impact on gross domestic product (GDP) is 20 times higher in developing countries than in developed countries.<sup>13</sup> These impacts pose a fundamental threat to the World Bank Group’s goals of eradicating poverty and boosting shared prosperity. 
Current development patterns contribute to the expansion of hazard and vulnerability factors and hence to the expansion of disaster risk. With regard to the generally accepted phenomenon of accelerating climate change, it is clear that CO2 release is related to an increase in the frequency and severity of hydro-meteorological hazards. As populations and urban centers are increasingly exposed to hazards, extreme geophysical and hydro-meteorological events are causing greater loss of life and property. The concentration of populations in vulnerable informal settlements through unregulated urbanization may be the greatest contributor to the rapid growth of disaster risk. Currently, some 1 billion people live in informal settlements; by 2020, nearly 1.5 billion people in the developing world will live in slums. By 2040, cities will be home to the majority of people who earn less than $1 per day.<sup>14</sup>
Vulnerable populations do not only suffer the prospect of catastrophic events, they also suffer from the more insidious and distributed losses of chronic risks, which kill thousands in fires and spontaneous collapse of poorly designed or defectively constructed buildings.  
Building codes and land use regulation have a crucial (and thus far insufficiently appreciated) role to play in investment programs for reducing disaster and chronic risk. To be effective, however, building codes and standards must be part of a larger “culture of safety” that includes engineering education and construction skills training as well as legislation, support for implementation, and enforcement strategies.<sup>15</sup>

## Objective
The objective of this report is threefold.
First, it will demonstrate how implementing and complying with building and land use regulation can reduce disaster and chronic risk and contribute to resilient construction. The potential for enhancing building regulatory capacity in low- and middle-income countries is a particular focus. 
Second, it will explore the feasibility of using building and land use regulatory implementation to promote public health, safety, and risk reduction, with a focus on rapidly expanding urban areas.
Third, it will call for a renewed and internationally coordinated effort aiming at promoting disaster risk reduction through efficient and effective building code implementation. As such, the report outlines a proposed programmatic approach consistent with the priorities set out in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030.

## A mandate to act now
On March 18, 2015, at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, representatives from 187 countries adopted the ___Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030___,<sup>16</sup> making it the first major agreement of the post-2015 development agenda. The Framework includes four priorities for action:
+ .Priority 1: Understanding risk
+ .Priority 2: Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk
+ .Priority 3: Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience
+ .Priority 4: Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to “build back better” in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.
Each of the four priorities for action references building and land use regulation development and implementation as a key element of disaster risk reduction. Specifically, clause (h) under Priority 3 states that to meet the framework’s goals, it is necessary 

“to encourage the revision of existing or the development of new building codes and standards and rehabilitation and reconstruction practices at the national or local levels, as appropriate, with the aim of making them more applicable in the local context, particularly in informal and marginal human settlements, and reinforce the capacity to implement, survey and enforce such codes, through an appropriate approach, with a view to fostering disaster-resistant structures.”

A key outcome of the Sendai conference was captured in a statement from its organizers after a session on the role of building regulation in DRR. The statement encouraged the international community to adopt a proactive agenda to develop regulatory capacity.  Furthermore, it offered six practical actions to help move beyond the broader objectives of the ___Sendai Framework___ to more tangible measures to reduce risks in the built environment (see Box I.1).
This positive outcome drew upon a multistakeholder review of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA)’s progress, which was prepared for the United Nations General Assembly in May 2014. The review emphasized the need to enhance good practices in disaster risk reduction, including standards setting for building codes, land use, and preparedness.<sup>17</sup>
As the Sendai outcome and its foundations in the HFA review suggest, there is a strong international consensus for exploiting the full potential of effective building regulations in reducing risks. This goal can be accomplished through renewed investment in regulatory capacity and functioning governance mechanisms. Insofar as it calls for an innovative international approach to disaster risk reduction, the ___Sendai Framework for Action___ agenda provides a robust platform for action in the 15 years to come.

## Key factors contributing to the expansion of disaster risk 
Several factors have contributed to the growth of disaster losses and the continued growth of disaster and chronic risk. 

### Rapid urbanization without effective regulation
Urbanization continues to concentrate people and the urban systems they depend on. The world will witness the construction of 1 billion new dwelling units by 2050 and a doubling of urban building stocks in the next 20 years.<sup>18</sup> Some 60 percent of the area expected to be urban by 2030 is in Asia,<sup>19</sup> and much of this area will likely be subject to natural hazards.
The developing world has witnessed massive rural-urban migration over the past century. This dramatic increase in urban populations has largely taken place without the benefit of building or land use regulation. Consequently, the percentage of the population in vulnerable buildings on hazardous sites has expanded. For example, the number of people likely to be exposed to tropical cyclones and earthquakes in large cities will more than double by 2050—from 310 million to 680 million and from 370 million to 870 million, respectively.<sup>20</sup> 

### Climate change
Weather-related disasters affect developed and developing countries, with highest impacts in middle-income countries. The largest coastal cities could experience combined disaster losses of $1 trillion by mid-century, as climate change resulting from increased greenhouse gas emissions has increased the intensity and frequency of severe weather and related events (hurricanes, flooding, mudslides, and so on). By 2030, there will likely be 325 million poor people in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and they will be vulnerable to weather-related events.<sup>21</sup>

### Growth of informal settlements
Urbanization has been a significant engine of economic growth, extracting millions of people out of poverty through access to jobs, education, and technology. However, this growth correlates with a significant increase in urban risks in the built environment—risks that can seriously erode the path out of poverty for millions. Over 103 million new slum dwellers have been added to the global population between 2000 and 2012,<sup>22</sup> and a majority of them are settled in disaster-prone areas.
Rapidly expanding urban areas are frequently established informally, without the benefits of risk reduction and guidance from building or land use regulations. Informal settlements often give rise to slums that suffer from overcrowding and a lack of basic urban services, including clean water, sanitation, electric power, employment, access to transportation, and access to health and educational facilities. 

### Failure to apply knowledge to practice
Our understanding of disaster and chronic risk has benefited from recent developments in science and engineering. For example, in the past 20 years, significant advances in the natural sciences have made possible the characterization and mapping of hazard events. Hydrological, meteorological, and geophysical hazards can now be charted in terms of frequency, intensity, and location. The world has also witnessed the rapid expansion of instrumentation in modeling and mapping for seismic micro-zonation using geographical information system (GIS) technology. This is an important step toward improved seismic risk analysis and mitigation.
In addition, engineering research has considerably improved understandings of material and structural performance of buildings and infrastructure; this is useful in evaluating seismic risks. Strong motion instruments placed in buildings measure how the structures respond to earthquake-induced ground motion. Therefore, when strong earthquakes occur, new data are gathered that enable engineers to improve structural and building code design requirements. The 1971 San Fernando earthquake in California provided data from instrumented buildings that supported significant improvements in seismic building codes, and eventually led to the creation of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), which conducts earthquake research and its application to code improvement.
The primary way that new scientific and engineering knowledge gets applied to design and construction is through building and land use regulatory regimes. However, where building and land use regulatory systems have been largely absent or neglected, there has been little benefit from scientific and engineering advances in improved building safety.
Globally, there has been very limited investment in increasing building regulatory capacity for disaster loss reduction. Between 1991 and 2010, the international community committed just over $3 trillion in development assistance. Of this, $106.7 billion was allocated to aspects of disaster resilience, primarily to post-disaster relief and recovery; only $13.5 billion was allocated to risk reduction measures. For every $100 spent on development aid, just 40 cents have been invested in disaster loss reduction. Flood prevention measures accounted for more than 90 percent of all disaster risk reduction expenditures.<sup>23</sup> This unbalanced distribution of funding has constrained the growth of institutions and tools needed to promote safe development and resilience, specifically  through the application of scientific and engineering knowledge.

## Successful risk reduction in developed countries based on building and land use regulation
In developed countries, successful mechanisms of risk reduction and hazard adaptation have relied in large part on effective and efficient regulation.  Regulations have dramatically reduced the incidence of urban conflagration and epidemic disease over the past two centuries. The proximity and density of urban development in Europe and North America made this elaboration of regulatory measures necessary.

### Incremental development of regulatory capacity
The implementation and expansion of building and land use regimes in developed countries has evolved incrementally over time. This process has created increasingly resilient systems able to sustain chronic and exceptional risks.
The city of New York was devastated by fires three times in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Each major incident contributed to a greater understanding of fire hazards and urban vulnerability. The regulatory institutions of the city served as the repository of this knowledge and, through code development and implementation, were able to improve building practice for fire resistance in small and incremental steps.  Through an institutionalized regulatory process, these accumulated responses contributed to collective knowledge and experience in the form of building codes that reduced the incidence of fires  over time.  As shown in Figure I.4, the occurrence of fire events in the city has been closely linked to a continuous, dynamic, and incremental process of regulatory responses to evolving risks and practices in construction. Today, with a sustained rate of less than 1 fire death per 100,000 inhabitants, New York City is one of world’s best-performing cities.<sup>24</sup>
The history of seismic risk reduction in California offers a compelling example of an incremental regulatory response expanded and improved over the last 110 years. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake stimulated the development of seismology and earthquake engineering through research and testing. Subsequently, the 1927 Uniform Building Code provided the first comprehensive earthquake design provisions.  In 1933, a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck Long Beach, California, and many of the unreinforced-masonry schools in the city suffered significant damage. Impressed with the loss of life that might have occurred if schools had been in session, the California legislature quickly passed the Field Act. This legislation required special earthquake design for public schools in addition to strict plan review and site inspection for all new schools by the Office of the State Architect. No school building in California has collapsed in an earthquake since the implementation of the Field Act. 
In 1971, the 6.5-magnitude San Fernando earthquake struck the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Two hospitals suffered major damage. In response to this experience, in 1983 the legislature passed the Alquiste Hospital Seismic Safety Act, which increased design requirements for new hospital construction and set a deadline for the seismic retrofit of all existing hospital buildings. The act also established the Seismic Compliance Unit in the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development.  Experience from frequent seismic events has contributed to continuous improvement of seismic codes and resulting building performance in earthquakes. In sum, California illustrates the evolutionary and dynamic process of regulations with no definite end in sight. These regulations for schools and hospitals remain in a state of evolution today as engineers learn new lessons from earthquakes around the world.
Regulatory process is accomplished at a very small percentage of total construction costs. In Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the added cost of a functioning permitting and inspection system is about 1.7 percent of total construction cost. 
The cost of establishing and maintaining a functioning regulatory system is dwarfed by the potential cost of disaster losses. Haiti suffered losses equal to 120 percent of the country’s GDP after the devastating earthquake of 2010. Typhoon Yolanda displaced 4 million people, destroyed half a million houses, and pushed more than 2.3 million people back into poverty after hitting the Philippines; consequently, the poverty rate increased nearly 15 percent.<sup>25</sup> Similarly startling statistics apply to many more countries worldwide.

### Tangible return on investment
Studies conducted in countries with more established building regulatory regimes consistently show that the benefits of up-to-date building codes outweigh any increase in compliance costs: 
+ .A study done by the U.S.-based Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) found that losses from Hurricane Andrew, which hit the states of Florida and Louisiana in 1992, caused more than $20 billion in insured damage. This loss would have been reduced by 50 percent for residential properties, and by 40 percent for commercial properties, if the structures had been built in accordance with Florida’s 2004 statewide building code.<sup>26</sup>
+ .Another IBHS study following Hurricane Charley, which hit Florida in 2004, found that conformance to current building codes reduced the severity of losses by 42 percent and loss frequency by 60 percent.<sup>27</sup>
Effective building regulatory systems bring about other societal benefits beyond chronic and disaster risk reduction. They can offer high returns for other policy objectives. Energy efficiency and CO2 reduction from buildings is a good case in point: a task force led by the Institute for Market Transformation found that every dollar spent on code compliance and enforcement returns six dollars in energy savings, equivalent to a 600 percent return on investment over time.<sup>28</sup>

## Key priorities
This report presents a set of interrelated, actionable priorities for risk reduction. These priorities set boundaries for the discussion and provide the framework within which recommendations are articulated. They have informed the outline of the proposed program developed in the last chapter. 
///Focusing on building regulatory regimes./// Building and land use regulations are closely intertwined and cannot readily be treated as separate issues. However, this report places primary emphasis on building regulatory regimes, with specific focus on the core implementation activities of plan reviews, inspection, and compliance assurance. These activities have received little attention in the context of DRR.
///Recognizing the larger regulatory “ecology” that supports effective building code implementation./// Beyond the core activities of a building code regime, there are contributing organizations, regulatory mechanisms, and institutions that are essential to achieving compliant, safe construction. This report acknowledges the important role of these institutions, which may include educational and training institutions for the building professions; accrediting bodies for professional education and building control; certification processes for contractors and developers; mortgage lending institutions qualified for building finance; property insurance and professional liability insurance for building professionals; and free and functioning real estate and land markets.
///Addressing the needs of the poor and vulnerable, primarily in low- and middle-income countries./// This report’s focus on the poor and vulnerable does not attempt to exclude other segments of the population.  Rather, it seeks to address those with the least capacity to cope with disaster losses. Between 1980 and 2012, low-income countries have accounted for only 9 percent of the total number of disasters while incurring 48 percent of fatalities.<sup>29</sup> Where regulations are unknown, unenforceable, or excessive, most people tend to disregard them, especially the poor. This report advocates large-scale educational efforts and implementation mechanisms appropriate and affordable for the disadvantaged. These efforts should accommodate incremental regulations compatible with incremental construction, adequate incentives, and compliance support. 
///Ensuring the safety of new construction and reducing the risk of existing vulnerable settlements./// A primary objective of this report is to limit the expansion of disaster and chronic risk in future urban development. This is critical insofar as building stocks are projected to double in the next 20 years in most emerging economies. Clearly, initial location of safe sites is inherently more economical than relocation of existing settlements. Likewise, achieving disaster resistance in new construction is considerably less costly than retrofitting existing vulnerable construction. 
However, given the populations currently exposed to disaster risk through existing unsafe structures, it is imperative that provisions for assessment and strengthening of vulnerable buildings be incorporated in the building regulatory initiative. Realistically, risk reduction in existing buildings will be a long-term priority. The development of regulatory capacity for new construction will provide a foundation for extending regulatory practice to the inspection and improvement of existing buildings.
///Creating the structure to deal with chronic health and safety risks./// This report takes the view that a building code regulatory regime will address disaster risks effectively by extending the institutional capacity needed to address everyday hazards such as fire, building collapse, epidemic, and unhealthy living conditions. Investment in building regulatory capacity has the double benefit of reducing loss to both chronic and disaster risks. Chronic risks and smaller disasters (such as individual building collapses) are rarely recorded, and rarely covered by government, insurance, or international assistance. The cost of impacts associated with small disasters tend to be absorbed directly by low-income rural and urban households. They are estimated to be 50 percent higher<sup>30</sup> than those formally recorded in global databases.
///Promoting compliance rather than police enforcement./// Although a traditional police enforcement function is necessary, it should be actively complemented by positive technical assistance and support for voluntary code compliance. This is particularly true for efforts to expand regulatory service delivery toward the informal sector. This report argues that understanding behavioral drivers, and the set of values upon which an effective regulatory system should be established, is crucial. In concrete terms, an effective reduction in risk requires more innovative and nontraditional regulatory approaches (such as guidance and educational effort typically deployed in reconstruction programs), which should be adopted and institutionalized in the mainstream permanent regulatory system for an effective reduction of risk.
///Leveraging private sector to expand technical resources for code implementation.///  Experience over the past 20 years points to the potential of leveraging private sector technical resources to expand the volume and quality of technical manpower available for review and inspection functions.  Modern compliance assistance tools include improved information systems on risks, building practitioners’ qualifications, private third-party checks, and the use of insurance-based incentives to reinforce building controls. This report highlights promising experience in this area that contributes to increasing the capacity of regulatory systems and reducing risks.  Far from a deregulation agenda, this approach promotes collaboration with private sector expertise that can strengthen the ability of building regulatory authorities to protect public health and safety and enhance resilience.
