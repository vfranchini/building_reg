# ConclusionBuilding and land use regulation has proven to be the most effective tools for reducing disaster and chronic risk in the developed world. For a range of reasons discussed in Chapter 1, low- and middle-income countries have not successfully employed these tools. With the initiation of the __Sendai Framework for Action__, there is now an opportunity to reengage in the challenge of reducing disaster and chronic risk in low- and middle-income countries. This new effort is armed with extensive experience and innovative approaches. Focused attention on the building and land use regulatory capacity of disaster-prone countries and municipalities can ensure positive outcomes.  For example, future construction and urban expansion will take place on safer sites.  Structures will be built to protect population health and safety, and disaster risk will be reduced.  Building regulation can work as a catalyst to leverage the total investment in building and infrastructure toward greater safety and security. By implementing building regulation and supporting active compliance, the proposed Building Regulation for Resilience Program can serve to accelerate the application of current scientific and engineering understanding to a safer built environment.
