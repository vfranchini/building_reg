<sup>68</sup> Data is unfortunately often not available or not comparable for construction related safety issues – and the relatively low frequency of accidents makes it difficult to build meaningful comparisons, hence our reliance on fire safety statistics as a proxy.

<sup>69</sup> This observation is in now measure limited to the Former Soviet Union nor should it be understood that we are singling out these countries – they were chosen because of data availability and because they have meaningful regulations on the books which if implemented appropriately should ensure a better level of safety.

<sup>76</sup>  World Bank 2014. This definition extends the traditional definition of the term since the World Bank generally defines “risk” as a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure. Consideration of “social consequences” provides an important element to better grasp and determine the relative notion of acceptable risk.

<sup>77</sup> To allow consistent comparisons, Doing Business records the cost required for a small medium-size business to obtain all necessary approvals to build as simple commercial warehouse and connect it to sewerage and water. The warehouse is assumed to have two stories, both above ground, with a total constructed area of 1,300 square meters). Each floor is three meters high.

<sup>78</sup> The term “applicable laws” refers to laws, regulations, and bylaws which would prohibit construction unless complied with. For example, an applicable law could include provisions that prohibit high-rise buildings in certain locations near runways and airports, or that regulate construction in floodplains or agricultural areas.

<sup>103</sup> To this effect, Victoria established a private-public “Building Practitioners Board”, an independent organization which oversees the quality and standard of the State’s building industry professions. 

<sup>104</sup> The “curadores” were legally established in 1995 as certified individuals delegated with the public responsibilities to administer building permit reviews and to issue permits. Curadores set up shop and were in full operation by January 1996. Initially, curadores were selected among experienced architects and engineers with construction experience.
