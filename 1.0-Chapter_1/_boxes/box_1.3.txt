Zimbabwe’s repeated attempts to improve housing conditions through building standardsZimbabwe gained its independence in 1980. One year later, the government introduced new building standards with the objective of improving the living standards of the population. This, however, was unrealistic, as the minimum compliance levels were unaffordable and unsustainable for the great majority of the population. The standards were introduced with good intentions but were driven by a rigid central vision that ignored the economics behind their implementation. That vision was hardly compatible either with local customs or the absorption capacity of the local industry. It introduced changes without any form of consultation with or broad participation of primary stakeholders. Only when a second review of standards took place in 1992 did regulatory authorities start to support more participatory and diverse programs focused on increasing local capacity and the local relevance of building standards. However, persistent problems with building standards, planning issues, and corruption have contributed to today’s serious shortfall in the construction of affordable housing in Zimbabwe, where a staggering 1.2 million people are now registered on the government’s national waiting list for basic shelter.The case of Zimbabwe underscores the importance of building standards that reflect local building practices and affordability. When standards are set too high, it is impossible for people to comply. Zimbabwe also illustrates the need to replace top-down policy-making processes with participatory approaches.  This case demonstrates the necessity of linking the introduction of building regulations with training and capacity building and of linking regulatory reforms to programmatic interventions. Source: IRIN, March 2013.
