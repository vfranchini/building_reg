Why the success of effective building controls in Trinidad and Tobago hinges on a commitment to transparency

The government of Trinidad and Tobago continues to push for the adoption of the draft Planning and Development of Land Bill, 2001, which includes detailed provisions for land use and construction permitting approvals.  The bill proposes cutting-edge innovations in building control procedures. 
Among other objectives, the bill seeks to end the bottleneck of permit requests at public building, planning, and permitting agencies while curbing the growth of illegal buildings. To do this, it empowers private “registered professionals” to establish the compliance of building projects with building codes and regulatory requirements from the water and environmental protection agencies. 
In order to be effective, it is critical that registered professionals know the approval requirements of various planning agencies.  Doing so will allow them to attest to compliance with agency requirements with reasonable certainty. Therefore, each agency should have to make all its requirements and approval criteria fully transparent and available on its website.
However, this innovative process has been weakened by delays from civil servants in development agencies, who resist transparency by postponing the publication of their specific compliance requirements. With no access to this information, the private sector cannot participate in building controls, and this promising and novel idea cannot be realized.
This example illustrates how emerging economies can be bold in trying to build technically more robust systems of building enforcement.  At the same time, it demonstrates how they can fall short of achieving the desired outcomes by failing to address the transparency element attached to any change process. Transparency should be the foundation of a modern and effective policy framework for building controls.
