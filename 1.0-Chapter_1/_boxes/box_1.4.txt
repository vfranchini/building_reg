Illustrating the restrained capacity of Lebanese municipalities to conduct building permit reviews and inspectionsLebanon illustrates the latter case of low municipal capacity, despite acute seismic risks in the country. Municipalities in Lebanon are underresourced and unable to adequately perform their limited role in conducting plan reviews and inspections of construction. The very modest role of municipalities in the building permitting process stems from a decision to centralize responsibilities for building controls within the Urban Planning Offices under the Ministry of Public Works and other central agencies. In Beirut, where the municipal office takes on more responsibility than in smaller municipalities, equipment and resources are very inadequate. Storage facilities for filing and the filing process itself are manual. The official land use plan for the local district of Beirut dates back to the 1930s and the era of the French mandate. Because revenues are low, municipalities have difficulty covering expenses related to inspections and are not able to provide adequate salaries to municipal building engineers. This challenge presents opportunities for pooling of human and physical resources—e.g., municipal unions could take on spatial management tasks—as a way of delivering more robust building permit services. These ideas have not yet been implemented, despite prevailing seismic risks in the country.
