## 1.8 Conclusion
The drivers of disaster and chronic risk continue to grow, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The processes of development drive populations from rural to urban areas, often to hazard-exposed floodplains, coastal areas, or seismic zones. This rapid expansion of urban population is taking place without the benefit of regulation to protect the health, safety, and welfare of new urban dwellers. Unregulated land use allows the settlement of hazardous sites, and unregulated construction allows the creation of vulnerable buildings. Rudimentary regulatory frameworks have been established in many cities of the developing world, but they are currently inefficient and largely ineffective. Weaknesses include incomplete legislative and legal foundations, codes unsuited to local conditions and practices, inept administration of codes at the local level, and failure to train and support the building sector to make code compliance feasible. Efforts to transfer code documents from developed countries have proven unrealistic, inappropriate, and self-defeating. Major obstacles to reducing risk and improving the quality of construction remain: the failure to address and improve local building culture, the failure to establish the legitimacy of the regulatory process through open processes of code development and implementation, and the failure to invest in or support the development of efficient and effective building regulatory capacity. All these have allowed disaster and chronic risk to expand in growing urban areas and have done nothing to address risk in existing vulnerable settlements.
