## 1.7 Failure to institutionalize post-disaster regulation
### Missed opportunity to introduce regulatory process for public buildings
Though the unregulated informal sector poses many challenges to public regulators of building and land use, there are opportunities for regulatory intervention in the area of public sector buildings. For instance, school building construction is typically managed by national or local authorities. Management and funding authority reside with governmental entities which should have the opportunity to exercise quality control over the siting, design, and construction of school buildings. School construction offers an opportunity to develop and demonstrate the benefits of building regulation and code compliance. This is an opportunity that has been ignored in many low- and middle-income countries from Haiti to China.

### Inability to take advantage of disaster experience to create permanent building regulatory institutions
In the aftermath of a major disaster, the need to improve construction quality and establish an effective building regulatory mechanism is broadly recognized. Where reconstruction is funded by external agencies, some building standards are often imposed as a condition of funding. There is also sporadic training of local construction workers in improved resilient construction.  However, these measures are not sustainable without the institutionalization of a permanent building regulatory authority, one with capacity for effective code implementation and maintenance. The failure to create permanent institutions after a disaster is illustrated by Haiti after its 2010 earthquake (failure to institutionalize regulatory function at local level), by Nicaragua after its 1972 earthquake (failure to institutionalize building regulation), and by Barbados after Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 (failure to improve wind design requirements).
