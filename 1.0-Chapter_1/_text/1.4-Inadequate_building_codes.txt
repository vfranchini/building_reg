## 1.4 Inadequate building codes 
### Inappropriate transfer of codes from high-income countries
To a large extent, the normative environment for construction, land use, and planning standards in developing countries has been strongly influenced by frameworks introduced during periods of colonial rule. Such codes often set the bar too high and thereby increase the dependency of developing countries on imported industrialized building materials and design practices. Furthermore, these codes frequently create high costs of compliance with a result of driving construction to the informal sector.
In Jamaica, it was estimated that only the wealthiest 15 percent of the population could afford housing that met the current formal planning and building standards. In Trinidad and Tobago, it is estimated that only the top 20 percent of the population can afford the median price of $21,500 for a housing unit that meets current formal building standards.  Code compliance is not feasible for low-income housing. As a result, low-income housing fails to benefit from health and safety regulations. This trend is now widely reflected globally.<sup>44</sup>
In sum, excessively rigorous and unattainable standards of construction have been a major obstacle for the expansion of regulatory compliance in the past four decades. Only relatively wealthy urban residents have been able to afford buildings that meet formal sector building regulations, thus creating cities with entrenched two-tier systems, widening social inequalities, and limiting progress on risk reduction.
Building codes are expressions of both social and technical principles. In order to achieve feasible compliance, they must reflect the social reality and the material possibilities of the society in which they are to be implemented.

### Participation in balancing acceptable risk and affordability
The code development process in most low- and middle-income countries, where it exists, is typically a bureaucratic process dominated by narrow technical concerns. If the code is to be relevant and feasible for implementation for all elements of the built environment, the development process must be open to broad participation, with representation from all sectors of the building industry as well as building owners, occupants, civil society, and scientific and engineering experts. Feasible building codes represent a socially acceptable balance between risk and affordability. This balance should be determined through an open and inclusive process that can be accepted as fair and legitimate. Narrowly framed technocratic regulation can have adverse consequences for low-income groups, setting unaffordable standards for building plot size or construction technique. Unrealistic standards lead to noncompliance and defeat of regulatory purpose.
Negotiation of code provisions should be based on a consensus process that represents the relevant stakeholders concerned with both the costs and benefits of safety.  The goal should be to balance the costs of regulations with the ability of people to pay.
However, governments at the national and local levels sometimes lack the capacity to lead participatory efforts, and for three reasons:  They may not be operating within a sufficiently accountable environment, they may lack the political structure to translate social priorities into specific regulatory measures, or they may lack the capability to conduct these consultations.
A participatory approach may simply be overlooked, as illustrated by the Zimbabwe example (Box 1.3). It may also be established without necessarily attaining an acceptable level of societal consensus by appropriately balancing acceptable risks and affordability.
For example, in Turkey, the current legislative framework has several provisions regarding multistakeholder participation in building, planning, and disaster risk reduction. However, in practice these forums have yielded very modest results in creating consensus around planning issues. Following the 1999 earthquake in Kocaeli, the National Earthquake Council was established as an independent body to support a large-scale strategic response to increasing risks. The Council proposed a National Strategy for Disaster Mitigation in 2002 and extended recommendations in 2005. Unfortunately, these reports were not translated into any decisive action agenda.<sup>45</sup> 
Specifically, in the area of standards and building codes, there is a consistent pattern of top-down developments in low- and middle-income countries. Technical experts, frequently driven by the legitimate goal of building by the “best available standards,” hold sway. However, these experts often neglect social and economic considerations and the actual capacity for implementation.
The revision of standards in Indonesia following the 1979 earthquake was consistent with the widespread practice of simply transposing highly sophisticated standards from a high-income country. This transfer failed to recognize the extent to which the borrowed standards incorporate the unique risk patterns, history, building traditions, and economic and social constraints of the originating country. It typically confined this important societal choice to technical experts, who did little to consider the socioeconomic differences between Indonesia and the high-income countries from which the standards were imported. At that time, authorities overlooked the experience of local implementers and overestimated their own capacity to enforce overly ambitious, expensive standards.

### Failure of codes to address locally prevalent non-engineered construction
Building codes transposed from higher-income settings frequently reference technical standards for a limited range of construction materials and methods.  Generally, methods and materials indigenous to the borrowing country are not included. However, indigenous construction practices are particularly relevant for low-income populations. Failure to consider improvement of health and safety measures for these construction types relegates them to the vulnerabilities of the informal sector.
Only a minority of established building code systems today are cognizant of this issue. Most of them do not yet offer any adequate range or “stratification” of technical standards to respond to different levels of sophistication and realities in construction. This problem is particularly evident when examining the absence of more localized technical standards.  If established, such standards could support and guide gradual improvements in the vast sector of vernacular and indigenous construction.
In addition, the requirements for professional qualification and licenses are problematic. They tend to be based on professional practice in the developed world and do not entail knowledge of relevant local, vernacular construction. Professional qualification frequently requires a Northern-style education, which rarely considers vernacular construction, even in low-income countries. As a result, young professionals are often wary of vernacular construction because it has not been a subject of their training. Building research, education, and professional licensing must do a better job of understanding, improving, and advancing critical knowledge of vernacular and non-engineered structures.

### Absence of guidance for improved resilience of traditional forms of construction
The majority of building codes in developing countries typically fail to recognize locally available building materials or prevalent forms of vernacular construction, such as adobe and non-engineered construction. (Notable exceptions include the building codes of Peru and Nepal). Such forms of construction typically account for 70 to 80 percent of residential construction in developing countries. With some attention to proven components of good construction practice, vernacular buildings can withstand extreme events and provide their inhabitants with durable shelter.
It is estimated that 30 to 50 percent of the world’s population lives in earth-based constructions. In several developing countries, this type of dwelling addresses the housing needs of more than 50 percent of the population and at least 20 percent of the urban and suburban populations.<sup>46</sup> 
Adobe construction is used and will continue to be used in many seismically active countries, in spite of the fact that poor-quality adobe houses do not perform well in earthquakes.  In most countries where adobe is widely used, however, there are no formal building codes or guidelines for adobe construction. This exclusion loses the potential for significant marginal improvement of economically and socially feasible risk reduction. In some countries, such as Argentina and El Salvador, building codes explicitly prohibit adobe construction in urban areas.<sup>47</sup> 
By ignoring or even prohibiting the types of construction that low-income groups can afford, codes effectively limit research and development for improving traditional techniques, materials testing, and quality control.  Thus these alternative forms of construction remain vulnerable. In turn, this lack of recognition eliminates opportunities for technically informed guidance for owner-builders of traditional structures.  In the absence of regulatory recognition, it is increasingly difficult to access finance and insurance for traditional building types.
The failure to address vernacular technologies in building codes has been an impediment to the understanding and improvement of those building traditions. In some cases, indigenous adaptations have proven resilient to natural hazards. The __dhajji dewari__, a traditional form of timber and masonry infill construction common in Northern Pakistan, has evolved over centuries and exists in similar forms in other earthquake-prone countries. During the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan, most of these structures suffered some damage, but very few collapsed. However, as no code of practice and formal recognition existed for this form of construction, donors were initially reluctant to support the construction of self-built __dhajji dewari__ in the aftermath of the disaster.<sup>48</sup> 

### Failure of building codes to address the prevalent pattern of incremental construction 
Building codes typically fail to recognize the incremental process of construction. Incremental construction refers to the gradual step-by-step process in which owner-builders append or improve building components as funding, time, or materials become available.<sup>49</sup>  In many cities of developing countries, this phased process of self-built construction is the dominant pattern of residential construction, accounting for 50 to 90 percent of new housing.<sup>50</sup>
Over the past few decades, governments have experimented with many different approaches to deal with a severe shortage of housing—with mixed results. In Latin America, households that were unable to meet housing needs through formal sector mechanisms typically resorted to informal solutions, specifically by obtaining illegally subdivided lots and constructing their houses incrementally. Without the benefits of health and safety regulation, such informal development continues to account for a major portion of the housing supply in Latin America.<sup>51</sup>
Incremental construction has been accepted in several countries through various approaches within the framework of specific projects, such as core housing. Recent affordable housing strategies have focused on community involvement and on encouraging self-help home building and renovation activities by households in urban settlements.  However, the building regulatory process has failed to provide guidance for incremental construction practices or to provide continuing oversight through the extended period of construction.

### Lack of quality control for building materials and equipment
A critical factor in building performance, aside from design and construction practice, is the quality of building materials. Resilient building design is based on assumptions regarding the strength and performance of constituent materials. In order to assure design performance of buildings, materials must be tested and certified as meeting design specifications. Many low- and middle-income countries lack the network of accredited materials testing laboratories necessary to certify the quality of building materials. This testing and certification is particularly important for modern construction materials, such as steel and concrete, and more complex building assemblies. However, materials testing can also be provided for indigenous materials and practices. In the 1970s, India’s Central Building Research Institute in Roorkee carried out extensive testing of earthen construction materials and applications as the basis for guidance on non-engineered construction.
A particular problem in the materials testing area is related to the use of reinforced concrete. Reinforced concrete is the principal structural material for urban expansion areas around the world. It allows for the construction of multistory buildings and is deceptively easy to use. The collapse of poor-quality reinforced concrete buildings is one of the principal causes of fatalities in the cities of low- and middle-income countries. 
Regulated construction requires that concrete samples from the construction site be tested for actual compressive strength in a certified testing laboratory. Without this testing, the quality of concrete construction varies widely and can result in failure during earthquakes. The “as built” does not always meet the design specification for the material. This was the case in Haiti, where, prior to the 2010 earthquake, there was only one materials testing laboratory, which was unable to provide testing for most of the construction in the country. 
The mixing of concrete is very sensitive to the proportion of cement to sand to aggregate and to water. Improper proportions and possible contamination of sand or aggregates with salt or organic material can weaken the concrete product, as can inadequate curing of concrete due to water shortage.  The 2011 collapse of the Langata Southern Bypass building in Kenya is largely attributed to the type of sand used, which was quarry dust. Quarry dust, as the name suggests, is very fine and flour-like. It has no bonding capacity and contains many impurities, which lessen the strength of the reinforced concrete. (Conversely, river sand has small sugar-like granules, which provide the necessary friction and tightly hold the concrete to the steel.)
Jamaica illustrates the nature of the challenge. The Jamaica Building Code requires the certification of four key building materials: cement, aggregate, concrete, and concrete masonry units. But the present Jamaica Building Code is 107 years old, dating from 1908, and is a voluntary rather than mandatory code. In Jamaica, cement is usually certified at port of entry. Other materials are not consistently checked, as site inspection is not mandatory and is rare in practice. The provision for certification of building materials exists, but is not enforced and is therefore ineffective. A proposed new Jamaican National Building Code, based on an adaptation of the International Building Code (IBC), would make these provisions mandatory. As in many low- and middle-income countries, standards exist but are not mandatory or implemented.<sup>52</sup> 
The Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) has the responsibility of ensuring that the materials used in construction meet required standards. Structural steel and reinforcing bar (“rebar”) are critical to building performance. The structural performance characteristics of steel depend on constituent materials and the fabrication process. Materials testing can determine the tensile strength or brittleness of steel building components. Without accredited independent testing, there is a risk of using steel that does not meet design specification and may contribute to future building failure. The unfortunate string of building collapses in Kenya (Box 1.1) also reveals deficiencies in both mandating and enforcing these essential tests.

### Limited access to code documents or training for code compliance
Builders and homeowners cannot comply with building codes if they are not familiar with them. This is a recurring challenge with regard to reaching poor and illiterate builders. Literacy levels among homeowners, engineers, architects, politicians, and builders vary enormously, and a distinction must be made between the guidance and support required by the general public (homeowners) and the various categories of professionals.
Building and land use regulatory frameworks are often written in a language that is difficult to understand, particularly for informal builders and low-income homeowners.  Regulations must be precise in order to ensure accurate and consistent interpretation in case of litigation. However, compliance cannot be achieved if codes are not translated into layman’s language and if they are not promoted through effective communications tools and awareness mechanisms, targeting both building practitioners and the general public.
