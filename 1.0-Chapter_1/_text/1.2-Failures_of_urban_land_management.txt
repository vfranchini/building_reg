## 1.2 Failures of urban land management
The provision of safe land is the most vital step that local governments can take toward controlling disaster and chronic risk in urbanizing areas. It requires regulatory mechanisms enabling the urban poor to access land that is not in high-risk areas as well as regulations that allow for tenure security, both for business and housing, in an affordable manner.<sup>37</sup> 
In dysfunctional regulatory systems, however, land management policies have typically failed to ensure land access, to link advances in hazard mapping with effective building code implementation, and to secure land rights in order to encourage investment and acceptable standards for the environment and for safe construction. As a result, land use regulation has contributed to a shortage of safe land, failed to limit settlement in hazardous areas, and often served to exclude a large proportion of the urban population from legal land and housing markets. These factors have significantly compounded risks for very large segments of rural and urban populations.

### Unavailability of affordable, safe, and accessible land
A critical factor forcing many urban dwellers into the informal sector is the extreme scarcity of land, which leads to prices that are unaffordableâ€”not only to the poor, but also to the middle class. Land is now under pressure everywhere as a result of increased demand and speculation. There are two major consequences related to excessive and speculative land prices.
First, for low-income people, the very high price of buying or renting a piece of land absorbs the bulk of financial resources available for housing.  This in turn limits their capacity to invest in safer building materials, construction, and skilled laborers, even where these would be available at a reasonable price. 
Second, a significant portion of the population cannot afford formal land tenure and thus are forced to choose informal land markets. In the Philippines, for example, high land prices are considered one of the main reasons driving about 40 percent of people to live in informal settlements. A detailed investigation found that the average cost of a house in an informal settlement costs roughly 10 percent of the price of a comparable unit in the formal sector.<sup>38</sup> 
As a consequence of this significant price difference between formal and informal housing, both low- and middle-income households have few options other than informal housing sectors, where vulnerability to chronic risks and natural hazards is considerably higher.

### Missing linkage of hazard mapping to effective risk reduction
Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in various parts of the world to map hazard exposure in terms of frequency and severity of expected events. Notably, the Probabilistic Risk Assessment Program (CAPRA)<sup>39</sup> in Central America has developed scientifically based probabilistic risk assessments for seismic and wind risks. Improved earthquake risk mapping has similarly been the focus of the GEM (Global Earthquake Model) program. 
These efforts are essential to risk reduction, but in themselves do not achieve that objective. Hazard mapping can only be translated into risk reduction through the effective implementation of building and land use regulation. This is why such efforts repeatedly fail to achieve their desired goals. The zones of the hazard map must be referenced to corresponding building requirements, and those requirements must become the basis for design, construction, inspection, and compliance. Without a functioning building regulatory regime, hazard mapping has no direct link to disaster risk reduction. 
Many countries that have benefited from recent hazard mapping still lack key components of effective regulatory implementation and have therefore not benefitted from any significant reduction of risk. Such is the case for Jamaica, which has recently completed its first seismic, wind speed, rainfall, floodplain, and land slippage hazard maps. But implementation of the building code is still impeded by delays in promulgating necessary legislation and more effective enforcement systems.
Haiti is also a case in point.  After it was struck by an earthquake in 2010, a seismic zonation study was carried out for Port-au-Prince. However, in the absence of an effective building code implementation, the existing hazard mapping has not yet been applied to effective risk reduction. Similarly, India has an earthquake risk map and a hazard atlas, but not a uniformly functioning building regulatory regime across the country.

### Consequences of insecure land tenure
Security of tenure is of pivotal importance to motivate investment in sustainable and safe infrastructure and housing. While there are different forms of tenure, two core components include reasonable duration of rights and effective legal protection against eviction or arbitrary curtailment of land rights.
In 2005, an estimated 934 million people lived without security of tenure in informal settlements. This number is projected to increase to 2 billion by <sup>40</sup>  More than 90 percent of the rural population in Sub-Saharan Africa accesses land via legally insecure customary and informal tenure systems, as do 40 million Indonesians and 40 million South Americans.<sup>41</sup>   Without secure tenure, people fear eviction and demolition of their homes. An estimated 5 million people worldwide suffer from forced evictions each year. Those with no or weak security of tenure are unlikely to invest in improving their homes or neighborhoods. They are even less likely to invest in more resilient construction or retrofit.  The lack of tenure security is not only related to a deliberate illegal occupation of land, but is often caused by unpredictable, costly, and time-consuming procedures associated with land registration. In Tanzania, for example, there are an estimated 28 steps which must be completed before a plot can be legally developed. In Lesotho, it can routinely take 18 months to complete the documentation for a lease before development can even start.<sup>42</sup>  Similar cases can be cited in many other countries.
As a result of widespread failure to provide tenure security, an increasingly large proportion of residents in low- and middle-income countries are not willing to make investments in property improvement or safety. In sum, they are deprived of the opportunity to accumulate wealth in the form of improved housing and security.
