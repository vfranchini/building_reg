## 1.6 Costly and inefficient building code implementation procedures
In addition to issues with design of legislation and governance, building permitting and inspections procedures frequently raise the cost of compliance for builders to high and unsustainable levels. Arbitrary and time-consuming building control administrative procedures are often perceived as the strongest disincentives for compliance with building regulations.  

### Increased bureaucratic burden does not correlate with more effective inspections
Unnecessarily complex administrative procedures to obtain land titles and building permits contribute to increased construction cost without clear safety improvement.  In many countries, the administrative procedures to obtain a formal building or occupancy permit are so complex, costly, and time-consuming that they inhibit code compliance. 
Paradoxically, low enforcement capacity and scarce municipal resources regularly coexist with overelaborated bureaucratic practices, highly restrictive regulations, and redundant inspections. Such patterns are seen in developing countries with a colonial background and in transition economies. Although the failure to inspect has dire consequences, the opposite case of overinspection also yields poor regulatory outcomes.
For example, __Doing Business 2015__’s rankings on construction permit efficiency ranked the Russian Federation 156th, Uzbekistan 149th, and Moldova 175th for the “dealing with construction permits” indicator.  In Ukraine, a considerable improvement took place in construction regulations as measured by __Doing Business__ over the last two years, but construction-related regulations and enforcement remain very inefficient.
This is true, in particular, of fire safety inspections. Over 40 percent of businesses in Ukraine are inspected per year, with two visits on average.  The most regularly updated indicator relating to safety of buildings is fire safety, and the aforementioned countries are covered by the international statistical compendium compiled by the International Association of Fire and Rescue Services (CTIF). All rate particularly badly in terms of fire-related deaths per 100,000 inhabitants—9.27 in Russia, 6.82 in Ukraine, 4.22 in Moldova, as compared to an average of less than 1 in 100,000 for most OECD countries.<sup>68</sup>  This data illustrates how countries with very intrusive regulatory systems can still end up with disappointing records on safety.<sup>69</sup> 
In Peru, one of the most important procedures to ensure building safety is the system of technical inspections administered by CENEPRED (the National Center for Estimation, Prevention and Reduction of Disaster Risk) and the municipalities. This system is based on comprehensive inspections of a large number of detailed technical specifications, with little attention to systemic issues or risk-based prioritization. In principle, all buildings should be licensed, and every license should require a thorough inspection and be subject to renewal. In practice, a large number of buildings are not considered, or are off the map: their owners simply evade the system and do not apply for a license in the first place. Because the system is based on licensing and not on site inspections, there is no way to detect off-the-map structures. A large share of buildings is never inspected. As for those which are checked, there is ample evidence that overzealous inspection does not necessarily benefit safety. The government is now engaged in a comprehensive reform of the regulatory system, which will introduce a risk-based allocation of inspection resources for a more focused approach to urban safety.<sup>70</sup> 

### Opaque language and limited focus on the poor
Oftentimes, information on administrative procedures and compliance requirements for building permits is difficult to access or unintelligible to nonprofessionals. Many builders catering to the housing needs of low-income people are not aware of official building requirements and related procedures.  This is due to both their low educational level and their limited interaction with planning and building agencies. In the housing sector, a major constraint is simply the ability of owners and builders to understand and conform to official requirements. In India, Tanzania, and Kenya, for example, planning regulations, standards, and administrative procedures are published in English, even though only a small proportion of the population—and an even smaller proportion of people in low-income segments—can read or speak English.

### Excessive permitting fees
Transaction costs borne by owners and builders for construction permits and inspections continue to be high in proportion to construction costs in developing countries. For example, in South Asia in 2014, it took an average of 14 procedures and 196 days to get a construction permit. Formal permitting fees averaged a staggering 12.8 percent of the overall cost of construction in the region. By comparison, the aggregate regulatory fees paid for planning and construction approvals is equivalent to 1.7 percent of the overall cost of construction in OECD countries. This fee is only 0.6 percent of the construction cost in Japan.<sup>71</sup> 
Further illustrating the patterns, in some Middle Eastern, West African, and South Asian countries, high permitting fees have become a de facto backup tax instrument.  In Lebanon, failures in land registration and cadastral systems have frequently stymied municipalities in collecting property taxes. As a result, they compensate for losses by charging very high fees for planning and construction permits, as well as other local licenses.
In Haiti, five years after the devastating earthquake of 2010, building authorities continue to charge developers construction permit fees equivalent to 16 percent of the cost of construction. This cost can be similarly high elsewhere, reaching as high as 20 percent in Madagascar and 25 percent in Serbia.  In the city of Mumbai, India, the formal cost of going through a planning and construction permitting process is equivalent to 46 percent<sup>72</sup> of the construction cost, making it practically impossible to comply with prevalent land use and construction permits requirements. 
This self-defeating response from local governments has failed to generate more revenues, further undermining compliance with appropriate safety standards and forcing development into the informal sector.

### Failure to mobilize private sector resources for code implementation
Countries that have the least efficient building control procedures as measured by __Doing Business 2015__ not only experience the regulatory failures previously described in this chapter; they also have enforcement systems that rely solely on public authorities and municipal building code officials to monitor construction and verify compliance with other applicable laws.
One of the greatest challenges for planning and building code enforcement agencies in developing countries is their capacity to carry out their mandate with extremely scarce resources in ever-expanding and ever-riskier cities. These agencies face severe and growing backlogs in planning and construction approval, inspection, and permitting processes. They also increasingly struggle to attract and retain well-trained and capable engineers and technical staff, given a competing private sector that often offers better pay and more attractive career prospects.
Reforming countries have seen the limitations of sole reliance on public resources in building code enforcement. Over the past decades, they have pursued different forms of collaboration with private building professionals in code compliance strategies, such as contracting out some control functions and establishing peer-review mechanisms. However, most developing countries have not yet taken this path.  They have not tapped into resources of skilled private engineers and building technicians that could be productively associated with more innovative code implementation systems. 
In the city of Bamako, Mali, authorities rely on resources located at the Urban Development Ministry for the review of land use and building permits. This is explained in part by the absence of competent public officials at the “communal” or submunicipal level. As of 2015, there were only four agents in the ministry to handle a city of nearly 2 million people. This is a paradox at a time when private civil engineering expertise abounds in the city, and the national school of engineering of Bamako<sup>73</sup> continues to enjoy a strong reputation at the regional level.

### Failure to exploit information and communications technology for efficient code implementation
The potential offered by ICT solutions has been only marginally tapped in the area of building code administration systems, specifically in permitting and inspection procedures.
Judging by an exhaustive measurement of recorded initiatives in the past 10 years (2005–2015), only 19 countries have introduced electronic platforms for building code and permitting administration. Out of 19 countries, two are upper-middle-income countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Costa Rica) and only three are low-income countries (Kenya, Nepal, Rwanda).74  As of today, only two countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have an operating online construction permitting system. Most countries in Central Asia do not have one.
The slow adaptation of ICT solutions for building code administration perpetuates inefficient practices and postpones such advances as easily accessible archives; coordinated inspections; integration of land titling, cadastral, land use, and building information; improved documentation; and effective mechanisms to relay inspection results back to builders and owners.
Although many of these deficiencies can be addressed through legal, regulatory, and process reforms, information technology has a key role in improving efficiency, transparency, and accountability in building code administration.
The Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project (ISMEP), initiated in 2005 and supported by the World Bank with a $460 million loan, was a major risk mitigation project established within the Istanbul Governorship Provincial Administration. Component C of the project aimed to improve institutional and technical capacities of building code administration by carrying out a thorough effort at reengineering and automating processes. Illustrating the range of issues at stake, the initial diagnostic carried out by the project team pointed out dysfunctional mechanisms that could be addressed by ICT solutions. Figure 1.2 presents an overview of these issues and how they could best be addressed by ICT.

### Regulatory resources not allocated in proportion to risk exposure
Many countries have benefitted from recent hazard mapping yet still lack the key components of effective regulatory implementation. The zones of the hazard map must be referenced to corresponding and proportionate building requirements, and those requirements must become the basis for design, construction, inspection, and compliance. Without a functioning building regulatory regime, hazard mapping fails to convert scientific knowledge into effective risk reduction measures on the ground.
In relation to chronic risks, building codes may fail to provide a building classification based on occupancy or, in terms of natural hazard risk, they may fail to reference maps of geographic and geologic hazards. In the Comoros, Côte d’Ivoire, Lesotho, and Ecuador, codes currently lack a building classification and related design requirements.  Thus, building enforcement agencies and builders do not have a common set of references to indicate the appropriate degree and intensity of regulatory controls for the specific class of risk into which the building falls. 

### Absence of appeal process for dispute resolution
With regard to land use and building code administrative decisions, the absence of independent professional appeal mechanisms can discourage builders from seeking solutions consistent with legal and technical requirements.
By nature, legislative and regulatory provisions can be open to different interpretations. There is often uncertainty related to administrative or technical regulations. Differences of interpretation among design practitioners and inspectors or permitting agencies can result in costly delays. The absence of appeal bodies with building code and construction expertise can lead to protracted conflicts, stalled permits, and inadequate safety guarantees. 
Even where appeal mechanisms are formally in place, they may not be sufficiently established to offer any effective conflict resolution. In most countries of western Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal, the law has provisions allowing (in theory) the appeal of decisions from the land and building authorities through the formal administrative judicial court system. However, such courts have no particular expertise in dealing with issues in construction. Because of rigid and costly procedural rules imposing multiple audits, resolution can typically drag over 5 to 10 years, making this option impractical and undermining the credibility of the formal process of dispute resolution.
