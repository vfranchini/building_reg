## 1.5 Weakness in building code administration and institutional capacity
A fundamental problem in low- and middle-income countries is the lack of funding and support for building regulation at the local level. However, even limited resources can be put to more effective use. Other forces such as opaque governance practices, regulatory capture, and corruption can hold back more immediate common sense solutions and contribute to a significant increase of risks in the built environment.

### Shortage of technically qualified personnel and funding at local and municipal levels
Local governments are responsible for approving development projects and building plans. They are in the front line of risk reduction in planning and building; they must pass bylaws on building regulations and prepare land use plans and emergency response plans.  However, many local governments, especially in smaller towns, do not have qualified technical staff.<sup>53</sup>
The extent to which municipal authorities can improve the supply of serviced land and deliver basic regulatory services is a function of both the pace of development and the country’s level of economic development. 
Developing countries have, for the most part, been unable to keep up with the demand for serviced land or to provide adequate basic services to residents of their rapidly growing urban centers. Some key obstacles have included shrinking central government transfers, inadequate local tax bases to pay for the delivery of services to a growing population, inadequate institutional capacity to prepare mid- and long-term development strategies, and insufficient funding to implement these strategies.
Few municipalities have complete authority over taxation, and so they struggle to create and sustain the capacity to service land and respond effectively to a growing demand for new construction. Local tax rates are often set by national or regional authorities and, as is the case in the Middle East, North Africa, and West Africa, property taxes may even be collected by a central authority and only partially redistributed to the municipality.<sup>54</sup>
As building stocks in developing countries are projected to double within the next 15 to 20 years, the pressure on local governments and municipal services to fund qualified building officials, adequately enforce building codes, and manage risks associated with new construction is only growing.
Many countries and cities fail to make effective use of private sector technical resources to augment governmental regulatory manpower. This failure has constrained regulatory capacity.
The more direct implication of low municipal capacity is that local planning and building agencies are often unable to conduct plan reviews of building projects or to carry out building inspections. Paradoxically, there are cases (for example, transition economies such as Tajikistan, Vietnam, or Ukraine) in which severely constrained regulatory capacity coexists with the execution of extensive untargeted and ineffective building inspections that are not prioritized on risk-based principles. This points to patterns of lack of capacity combined with ineffective use of scarce control resources.

### Corruption in building control functions
Corruption is at the heart of failed regulatory frameworks, as it undermines all aspects of good regulations. Corruption is strongly correlated with poverty, and in low-income countries it may seem to be an intractable problem for efforts to create a robust environment for building regulatory compliance.<sup>55</sup> 
In its various forms, corruption remains an entrenched, man-made failure—one that destabilizes the construction industry, stymies the necessary reforms of building oversight mechanisms, and is a dominant factor in the scale of fatalities in earthquakes.<sup>56</sup>  The manifestations of corruption related to the construction sector can be divided in three major categories:
+ .Corruption linked to government contracts
+ .Corruption linked to theft
+ .Corruption linked to circumventing regulations
The evidence suggests that combined, these different streams of corruption lead to poor-quality construction. They also lead to insufficient maintenance, which can significantly reduce the economic return to investments while carrying high human costs in terms of injury and death.<sup>60</sup> 
Experience in Latin America also points out that in some instances, opportunistic political figures have facilitated the occupation of hazardous sites and unsafe structures as a populist appeal to disadvantaged populations. For example, Cerro Norte in Bogota, Colombia, developed mostly as an informal settlement in the 1970s. Subsequently, in the 1980s, politicians lobbied for large-scale regularization programs in exchange for votes, although most of the area was considered vulnerable to floods and landslides.<sup>61</sup> 
This report focuses on the third of the three types of corruption identified above. 
Consistent sources of data point to the nature and the depth of overwhelming corruption in building controls. The World Bank Enterprise Survey shows that over 30 percent of firms in South Asia and the Middle East are expected to give gifts in exchange for construction permits. In countries such as India, Ukraine, and Yemen, these rates hover in the 60 to 80 percent range.<sup>62</sup>  
The 2008 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) covered almost 12,000 firms in 29 transition economies in southeastern Europe and Central Asia.<sup>63</sup>  The survey suggests that of all administrative transactions, construction permitting is the regulatory area most prone to corruption—more so than meeting with tax inspectors, obtaining an import license, or applying for a water connection.
Corruption in building code enforcement is associated with some of the worst possible disasters. Before the 1999 earthquake in Turkey that killed 17,000 people, 65 percent of apartment blocks in Istanbul and other cities had been built in violation of local housing codes.  These structures were built by contractors who skipped soil tests, built extra floors, and ignored specific seismic requirements. Turkey had a building code with sophisticated earthquake-resistant provisions prior to the earthquake. This failure was first and foremost a collapse of the code implementation system. It was partly enabled by widespread petty corruption that incentivized building inspectors to look the other way and let poor building practices develop on the ground. These factors led a prominent company specializing in risk management and information services to conclude that 

“almost all of the damage caused by the earthquake, and almost all of the deaths caused by the collapse of inadequately designed and constructed buildings was avoidable.”<sup>64</sup>

Recent statistical evidence shows that 83 percent of all deaths from earthquakes in the past three decades have occurred in countries considered most corrupt by Transparency International. The correlation is striking, and shows that the majority of fatalities from earthquakes can be attributed largely to regulatory failure and the effects of corruption.<sup>65</sup> 

### Corruption or regulatory capture?
In practice, corruption and regulatory capture can be difficult to differentiate. Regulatory capture occurs when special interests co-opt policy makers, and especially regulatory agencies, to further their own ends. Regulatory agencies eventually come to be dominated by the very industries they were charged with regulating, and eventually to act in ways that benefit those industries rather than the public.
Regulatory capture has been at work in various areas such as transportation, telecommunications, financial services, energy, environmental policy, and construction.
The practical effects of capture in building code implementation can considerably alter regulatory outcomes and lead to unintended consequences, such as
+ .Reducing safety standards to benefit the regulated industry;
+ .Conversely, increasing safety standards to unsustainable or unaffordable levels for local owners and builders;
+ .Creating unwarranted barriers to entry to protect the regulated industry from competition; and/or
+ .Stalling reform efforts.
In Jordan, a comprehensive review of building codes in the mid-1990s was driven by parties within the construction industry, consulting firms, and the Engineers’ Association that efficiently lobbied for excessively high factors of safety regardless of affordability and implementation skills. The need to find economically viable solutions was therefore undermined by this effort. The introduction of these new standards created tensions with local engineers, who lacked the technical support to meet new requirements. The sudden change in requirements led to increased construction costs and a professional competency gap that resulted in cases of building collapse. 
Regulatory capture can stall necessary and legitimate regulatory reforms. The promising legislation passed by the government of Turkey in the immediate aftermath of the devastating 1999 earthquake introduced significant innovation into building code enforcement with strong potential to reduce risks in new construction. This legislation was opposed by engineers in the public sector who advocated exclusion of public buildings, restricting the legislation to private construction. Shortly after the passage of the decree,<sup>66</sup> other professional interest groups led an opposition campaign against the enactment of more rigorous requirements for professional qualification.<sup>67</sup> 

### Lack of transparency in design and implementation of regulatory processes
Accountability means that regulatory policy development, administration, and enforcement are subject to public scrutiny so that regulators are accountable for their action.
Reform experience in building oversight procedures in areas such as health, sanitation, and education demonstrates that a commitment to the quality of effective public services is determined by the degree of transparency and the existence of a level playing field for all who need to access information.
Closely related to corruption and capture, a pervasive lack of transparency in regulatory design and implementation repeatedly degrades the quality and impacts of building regulations. Oftentimes, the failure to introduce transparency lies in the protection of a system of “insider trading” and cronyism.  In these instances, only insiders have access to good development parcels or are able to benefit from land value gains where public authorities are investing in infrastructure. 
Introducing transparency raises the challenge of keeping these interest groups at arm’s length from building oversight processes. The depth and sustainability of building code compliance is largely determined by the leadership of political and regulatory officials (at both the national and local levels) in addressing the root causes of regulatory capture and obstruction.
In building control procedures, the deliberate choice of not implementing transparent oversight procedures increases the cost of the regulatory approval process. Lack of transparency disengages developers and owners, who will thus continue to be uninformed and unable to submit complete and compliant building project applications. This factor can considerably weaken compliance with land use and building codes.
