## 1.1 Introduction
### Obstacles to effective building and land use regulation
In recent decades, the acceleration of rural-urban migration in the developing world has taken place largely in the absence of effective building or land use regulation. Without regulatory guidance, urban development has extended to hazardous sites and resulted in the construction of unsafe vulnerable settlements. This process of unregulated urbanization has led to a vast expansion of global chronic and disaster risk.
The failure of regulatory policy and implementation in low- and middle-income countries has several principal root causes. Rural poverty has been a major reason for urban migration, and poverty has been a limiting factor in the development of municipal services and regulatory capacity. Disregard for factors contributing to risk, in terms of hazard exposure and unsafe construction, has led to dramatic expansion of vulnerable informal settlements. The failure of building regulation has been compounded by poorly formulated and poorly communicated building codes. Corruption of local regulatory authorities, where they do exist, has further compromised implementation of and compliance with safe building and land use principles. 
Physical and social challenges arise in the context of high-density urban development that require more sophisticated institutions to manage the balance between individual interests and the health, safety, and general welfare of the community.
For millions of people in the developing world, it is primarily the absence of relevant codes and building standards, their inability to get their own voices heard in standards development processes, the high costs of compliance, and the lack of a supportive institutional environment which have impeded their access to safer and affordable housing in the formal sector.  Consequently, although building regulation has successfully reduced risks in developed countries, incomplete and inept regulatory implementation has often failed to protect lives and property in low- and middle-income countries. 
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the major systemic problems and failures in regulatory governance typically experienced in the extension of regulatory capacity in low- and middle-income countries.

### Deadly consequences of unregulated development
Earthquakes are the deadliest natural hazard. In developing countries, earthquake-induced building collapse kills many people. Although earthquakes represented only 4 percent of all hazard events between 2000 and 2009, they were responsible for 60 percent of disaster-related deaths in low- and middle-income countries.<sup>31</sup> Experience in the developed world has demonstrated that improved design, construction, and regulatory compliance can dramatically reduce life loss in earthquakes.
In 2003, the Paso Robles, California, and Bam, Iran, earthquakes had similar magnitudes and struck within three days of each other.  However, the death toll was two in Paso Robles as opposed to more than 40,000 in Bam—nearly half the city’s population.<sup>32</sup>  

### Failure to address both chronic and disaster hazards
Chronic health and safety risks related to the built environment are underestimated and overlooked. Efforts to reduce the risk of large-scale acute events may have obscured appreciation for the cumulative impact of smaller chronic risks.  Increasing evidence suggests that the cumulative impacts of everyday hazards resulting in small, isolated losses are actually greater than those of large disasters resulting from extreme events.<sup>33</sup>   The impacts of the former in low- and middle-income countries are widely misjudged, as they regularly fail to meet the criteria to qualify as “disasters” in international databases. As a result, a significant share of damage to housing, infrastructure, and low-income households affected by small disasters has been poorly reported and overlooked.<sup>34</sup>  
Research on African urban centers points out that a large share of the urban flooding, disease, epidemics, large shack fires, and spontaneous building collapses that occur in these locations does not get recorded as a “disaster” in national and international databases.<sup>35</sup>  Each year, however, thousands are killed by fires in, or the spontaneous collapse of, poorly designed or constructed buildings or structures. In India, for example, 2012 saw more than 2,600 deaths and 850 injuries as a result of the spontaneous collapse of 2,737 building structures.<sup>36</sup>  
In April 2013, an eight-story commercial building collapsed in Bangladesh, killing over 1,200 people.  This is another tragic reminder of the need to improve the safety of people from chronic risks. The benefits of building safety regulation should expand to all vulnerable segments of the population.
A particularly strong pattern of cumulative fires and spontaneous building collapses in Kenya over the past 20 years further illustrates how systems of building code regulation can fail in dealing with chronic risks. Over time, the aggregated loss of human lives and infrastructure in some of the largest cities in Kenya can be unequivocally defined as a disaster of significant proportions.
Failure to develop and implement effective building regulation is doubly detrimental to low- and middle-income countries. Not only do they suffer the prospect of catastrophic loss due to major disasters, they are also impacted by the continuing, distributed losses of chronic threats to health and safety such as fire, building collapse, epidemic, and unhealthy living conditions.
This chapter describes the major factors limiting the effectiveness and efficiency of regulatory frameworks in low- and middle-income countries. These factors are related to
+ .Land use and land governance systems;
+ .Legislative foundations for effective building code regulatory regimes at the national level;
+ .Building code design and building standards of construction;
+ .Building code administration and institutional capacity; and
+ .Concerns with the efficiency of building code implementation procedures.
