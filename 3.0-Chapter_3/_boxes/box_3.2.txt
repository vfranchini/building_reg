How Jamaica adapted and localized an international model building code

In 2003, the Jamaican Institute of Engineers initiated the development of the Jamaican National Building Code (JNBC). Early in this process, the working group favored the ICC’s model building code as the base code for Jamaica. Rather than transposing the ICC code into Jamaica, the approach consisted of drafting an application document to the ICC to present special values, parameters, and conditions for Jamaica. 
This approach had tangible advantages for Jamaica. First, it spared the reform team the high transaction cost of developing an entirely new document from scratch. Secondly, it enabled Jamaica to tap into a building code system that was adequately resourced to keep the code current with the constant changes in building technology and weather patterns. 
Furthermore, using the ICC model code satisfied three major directives from the government of Jamaica—namely, that the code should cover the widest possible range of building types, ensure as far as possible that no single disaster could destroy the entire building infrastructure of Jamaica, and assure that all buildings could be accessible by the disabled. An essential task of the working group assigned to the project was reviewing five ICC codes and writing the appropriate application documents that provided the local calibration and necessary adjustments to specific national construction techniques and risk environment.
