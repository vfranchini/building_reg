A standardized simplification of building permitting procedures: A four-stage approachTo be effective, administrative simplification should proceed in four stages. The approach outlined below was used in Turkey after the 1999 earthquake; in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru in the past 10 years; and more recently in Kenya and Rwanda (respectively in 2011 and 2012). 1..	**Process mapping**: The outcome is a detailed description of all the steps and procedures, the average duration of each procedure, the related fees, the documentation required, and the specific legislation or regulation prescribing this step or procedure.2..	**Re-engineering of procedures**: Working groups analyze the procedures with the objective of removing those that are redundant or add no value to controls and risk management. A reengineering process can be supported by a predefined “target process” considered consistent with best practices and with the objective of minimizing transaction costs. For example, in Ontario, documentation in support of municipal reform efforts recommended a standardized seven-step process of inspections for certain types of buildings and occupancy.3..	**Testing**: This stage formalizes new processes and trains building code officials and inspectors.4..	**Automating the new process**: This stage establishes online submission of building plans, work-flow management, online issuance of permits, archiving of documentation, and reporting.
