The Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project (ISMEP)Initiated in 2005 and supported by a World Bank Group loan of $460 million, ISMEP aimed to enhance the institutional and technical capacity of Istanbul, Turkey, in addressing seismic risks. Component C of the project had a budget of about $5 million and focused on improving building code enforcement in two pilot districts of Istanbul. A thorough reengineering and automation of construction permits and inspections services was carried out from January 2007 to December 2012, involving the building authority of the Municipality of Bağcilar.The scope envisaged for the shift from paper to online processes was particularly ambitious, as it involved+ .Updating and digitizing a comprehensive database with detailed spatial data at the individual building level.+ .Synchronizing GIS and MIS data into a single database at the municipality level.+ .Digitizing of archives involving more than 47,000 paper folders.+ .Training on new processes of over 100 people internally, in the municipality.+ .Developing an online system for land use approvals and construction permits. + .Creating a dedicated call center to handle client requests.Supported by a preexisting law promulgated in 2004 and recognizing e-signature, Bağcilar became the first municipality in Turkey to develop online building permit services. As of October 2012, the project had reduced necessary documentation by 35 percent and had reduced time for issuing a building permit by 55 percent. Source: Adapted from Reis 2015.
