Three major themes in the IAS accreditation processIn strong alignment with recommendations made in this chapter, the IAS accreditation criteria for building departments typically determine whether the local authority is committed, among other things to**Transparency and procedural justice**: The accreditation requires that the building department provides documented evidence of steps taken to avoid potential conflict of interests (3.2.6); that complaints and appeal mechanisms are in place for administrative decisions taken by the department (2.5); and that there is evidence of community outreach activities and disclosure of important documentation to the public (3.2.21).**Quality of service delivery**: A system must be in place to regularly measure progress in meeting service goals such as turnaround time (2.28). Quality assurance programs must be in place and include a range of self-imposed standards, such as audits and management controls (2.25), and there should be a tracking system for continuing education requirements (3.3.8). **A sufficient focus on disaster risks**:  The agency should provide evidence that staff have met training requirements for performing post-disaster assessments and making substantial damage determinations in flood hazard areas. Two other DRR-related requirements include (a) the development and disclosure of adequate information on wind zones, flood hazard areas, seismic areas, or other geologic risk zones (3.1.2), and (b) demonstration by building departments their preparation is coordinated with other departments when they identify damaged buildings and conduct safety inspections after a hazard event (3.2.3).Source: IAS, “Accreditation Criteria for Building Departments and Building Code Enforcement Agencies, AC251.”
