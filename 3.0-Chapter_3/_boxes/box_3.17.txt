UN-Habitatâ€™s proposed incremental approach to improving tenure security1.  Provide basic short-term security for all households living in slums and unauthorized settlements and with informal or customary rights in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. This can be best achieved through land proclamations, or through a simple statement by the relevant minister, for a specific period (typically three to nine months).2.  During this period, survey all extra-legal settlements in urban and peri-urban areas and identify any that need to be relocated. Offer residents priority for relocation to sites with close access to livelihood opportunities together with long-term tenure options.3.  Designate all other extra-legal settlements as entitled to medium-term forms of tenure with enhanced rights though not necessarily full titles. A simple option is to allocate community-based leases for a designated period, with options for extension.4.  Where effective local land management arrangements are in place, communities can be offered long-term tenure, for instance through Community Land Trusts, community-based titles, or cooperatives.5.  Households seeking individual titles obtain the agreement of the community, agree on property boundaries with their neighbors, and are responsible for financing and completing the necessary legal and administrative procedures, including the appointment and payment of surveyors and lawyers and property legislation.Source: Kagawa 2002.
