The Pakistan Rural Housing Reconstruction Program, post-2005 earthquake

The 2005 earthquake in Pakistan killed over 75,000 people and left more than 2.8 million in need of shelter. The government of Pakistan, in collaboration with the World Bank and other international partners, responded by launching a reconstruction program at a cost of over $1.5 billion.
The reconstruction and repair of 600,000 units in scattered communities required a vast workforce with appropriate skills and training. In response to this need, a “cascaded training” regime was implemented throughout the affected area to create a critical mass of artisans, masons, and craftsmen knowledgeable in seismic standards and methods of construction. The “cascade” was designed to provide training to master trainers at the district level, who would in turn train craftsmen and the affected population in the widely scattered communities.
Included in this training regime was the construction of model houses at field level to allow trainers to demonstrate seismic-resistant construction techniques to masons and craftsmen. After the trainings concluded, the houses were left in place for continual demonstration. The masons and craftsmen that underwent this training program were certified, so that homeowners knew they were qualified for the reconstruction and repair work.
Another major innovation was the use of a special corps of building inspectors. These inspectors not only carried out inspections but also provided on-the-spot assistance and training on seismic-resistant standards if, during an inspection visit, the construction was found to be noncompliant.
