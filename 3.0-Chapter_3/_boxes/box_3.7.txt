Box 3.7   How building regulatory decisions are appealed in Ontario, CanadaTo ensure efficient and fair appeal decisions, professional regulators and industry professionals should participate in specialized conflict resolution bodies, and their views should carry the same weight as those of other members.In Ontario, the Building Code Commission (BCC) is established by law. Although its members are appointed by the minister of housing, all commission members have appropriate technical expertise and are appointed from both the regulatory and industry sectors. BCC decisions are binding but case-specific. Hearings never exceed eight weeks, which presents a decisive advantage of the BCC over the main court system. When this new appeal mechanism was introduced in the early 2000s, the backlog of long-term pending building permit requests was rapidly reduced by 25 percent.
