Limitation of development in hazard zones: Allowable land use in floodplains in Minnesota, United StatesIn the state of Minnesota, land use and building regulation measures have been applied to reduce flood losses in the United States. As a result, for some parts of the floodplain or in some communities, options for permissible land use are very limited. In other parts of the floodplain, most uses are allowed, but structures must be elevated or flood-proofed to maintain public safety and minimize risk of property damage during a flood. Communities will be regulated according to zones, which include low-density residential, high-density residential, commercial, industrial, and open space. A community can specify the allowable uses in each zone. **Allowable floodway uses** + .Open space uses and limited grading and earth moving may be permitted if they do not create an obstruction or cause any increase in the flood levels. Uses such as gardens, farming, parks, trails, or golf courses may be allowed depending on zoning district. + .New structures, additions to existing structures, and substantial improvements to existing structures are prohibited. + .Construction should be outside the floodplain, with the lowest floor (including basement) above the regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE).  The RFPE is the 100-year flood (1 percent annual probability flood) elevation. The lowest floor must be elevated so that its walking surface is at the RFPE or higher.**The key building standards that meet state and federal law**+ .No placement of fill is permitted in the floodway.+ .Top (that is, walking surface) of the lowest floor (including basement or crawl space) is at or above the RFPE.+ .Fill outside the floodway is at 100-year flood elevation plus floodway stage increase, or higher, extending at least 15 feet horizontally from all sides of the structure.+ .An “as built” survey is submitted to the zoning authority to verify that the development was built at the permitted elevation.+ .All local ordinance requirements, including setback requirements (that is, from lot lines and for shore land management or wild and scenic rivers ordinances), are met. Many communities also require that the access (driveway and access roads) elevation is no lower than 2 feet below the RFPE.Source: Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Ecological & Water Resources.
