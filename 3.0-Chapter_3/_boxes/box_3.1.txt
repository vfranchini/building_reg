Historical evolution of building codes in Japan

Japan has an extensive history of devastating earthquake disasters.  However, building codes have significantly contributed to making Japan one of the world’s most earthquake-resilient countries.
 
**1919**
Following serious earthquake damage to modern structures during the 1800s, scientific and engineering analysis provided the basis for the Urban Building Law of 1919. This law was introduced to regulate building construction in six major cities in Japan.
 
**1920** 
In 1920, following the enactment of the Urban Building Law, the Law Enforcement Order introduced two key innovations. The law established Japan’s first building permit system, which was operated by the police under prefectural government. In addition, it included technical requirements for usage, height, and other safety specifications associated with zoning and building codes, as well as structural design requirements for timber, masonry, brick, reinforced concrete, and steel construction. 
The 1920 regulations also included allowable stress design, quality of materials, and dead and live loads—but not seismic requirements. 
 
**1923 - 1924**
The 1923 Kanto earthquake registered a magnitude of 7.9. It resulted in significant damage to modern buildings, as well as those using reinforced concrete. This experience and subsequent analysis led to an important revision of the Urban Building Law in 1924. These revisions included the introduction of seismic force considerations and subsequent advances in seismic design methods.
 
**1949** 
Post-World War II reconstruction considerably expanded building regulation with the following legislation:
+ .Construction Trade Law (1949)
+ .Building Standard Law (1950)
+ .Architect Law (1950)
These new laws aimed to safeguard the life, health, and property of citizens by providing minimum standards concerning the site, structure, equipment, and use of buildings; to define the qualification of engineers who could design buildings and supervise construction work; to improve the quality of those engaged in construction trades; and to promote fair construction contracts.
Aside from the legal code documents, the contemporary building regulatory system of Japan referenced standards developed by qualified government and nongovernment organizations such as
+ .Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport & Tourism (Ministry of Construction at that time) 
+ .The Architectural Institute of Japan 
+ .The Japan Concrete Institute guidelines, specifications, and manuals
 
**1971**
Further key legal developments were marked by a revision to the Building Standard Law in 1971, which introduced expanded seismic design codes.
 
**1981**
Building on the foundations of the National Comprehensive Technical Development and Research Project (1972–1977) led by the Ministry of Construction, Japan’s building code was considerably updated. The revised code, the majority of which is still in use, set the requirement that buildings be able to endure collapse or any serious damage to the structure and its users at extremely large earthquake scales with a return period of 500 years. In addition to the original standard that required buildings to withstand a lateral force of 20 percent of their total weight without damaging structural members, this standard set mandatory requirements for the ductility of the structure to withstand a lateral force of 100 percent of its own weight.
 
**1995**
The Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake in 1995 proved that an improved building code can make a significant difference in the rate of building collapses. 97 percent of collapsed buildings had been built under old building codes, while those that complied with updated codes represented only 3 percent of the total number of collapsed buildings. This triggered a nation-wide large scale reinforcement of existing buildings. However, it also revealed previously unrecognized weaknesses in construction, which resulted in further refinement of seismic codes and responses to new developments impacting building regulation and safety. 
 
**1998**
The Building Standard Law of Japan was revised in 1998, partially with the goal of introducing performance-based design regulations. The law also opened the building inspection and certification process to private companies, thus supplementing local governments who were previously the only competent authorities for conducting this process.
 
**2006**
The process for validating structural calculation was considerably strengthened following cases of code violation in 2005.
 
Dramatic Reduction of Damage due to Earthquake Ground Motion
Japan’s dynamic incremental improvement of building code provisions serves as an outstanding example of the value of combining building research and regulation to meet the challenges of disaster risk reduction. Continuous improvement of building codes, including rapid incorporation of lessons learned from disaster experience and thorough implementation of regulatory provisions, has supported a dramatic improvement of seismic performance in new Japanese construction.
