How FYR Macedonia ended a bureaucratic system of building code implementation by collaborating with the private sectorDrawing from the experience of European Union countries, and in an effort to improve building safety and compliance, FYR Macedonia radically amended its Construction Act in 2008. The change introduced mandatory licensing for engineers and contractors. It also allowed private independent engineers to review design and construction to establish compliance with approved plans and building code requirements. Municipal authorities were no longer involved in technical building reviews; instead, modern-day municipalities now ensure that the appropriate process is followed and that buildings are constructed in accordance with local planning and zoning requirements, controlling building size, setback, height, and use.A preliminary review of the reform conducted in 2012 concluded that the move toward independent private sector compliance checks was effective and efficient. FYR Macedonia jumped 86 ranks in the indicator for “dealing with construction permits” in __Doing Business 2012__. It avoided the pitfalls of an overly bureaucratic system, freed up resources in local planning departments, and created more reliable checks and balance in a country marked by frequent seismic activity.
