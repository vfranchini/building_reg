The Peruvian Building Seismic Code for earthen buildings

The first Peruvian Adobe Seismic Code was approved in 1985 as an integral part of the National Building Code. This code has been used to develop general guidelines to generate seismic codes and as a crucial reference for the development of seismic codes in other vulnerable countries, such as India and Nepal. It was updated in 2000 to describe the scope, general requirements, and definitions of structural elements and components. It describes the seismic behavior of adobe buildings and provides specifications for the dimensioning of the structural systems and the design of adobe walls.
The earthquake-resistant code provisions for adobe are addressed to professionals involved in the design and construction of adobe buildings, not to certified professionals that typically operate in the formal building sector. In most countries, only certified professionals are legally allowed to approve and sign off on design projects, and thus belong to the formal system. Most of the people that build and live in adobe houses do not know or use the code; therefore, most adobe codes for seismic areas do not effectively influence building practice.
After issuing the Peruvian Building Seismic Code for earthen buildings, Peru has found it is necessary to complement these codes with construction manuals, booklets, and guiding materials, as well as with educational campaigns carried out through local governments, NGOs, and the media.
