A promising example in a lower-middle-income country: How Guatemala developed a new accredited laboratory for building materialsIn 2002, Guatemala established the Guatemalan Accreditation Body (OGA), a key component of the National Quality System within the Ministry of Economy. In 2014, OGA awarded laboratory accreditation to Centro Tecnologico del Cemento y Concreto (CETEC)  for ISO/IEC 17025. This is the main ISO standard used by testing and calibration laboratories to demonstrate their technical competence. The main technical areas covered by CETEC include concrete, cement, soil mechanics, and chemical tests. The laboratory is equipped with testing equipment for cement, lime, concrete, aggregates, and soils. Its annual operating budget is approximately $1.5 million.With an internationally recognized accreditation body (OGA), Guatemala has actively started to accredit conformity assessment bodies, including construction materials testing laboratories. This step represents a remarkable move toward improving public health and safety. It also demonstrates that the country understands the importance of construction materials quality in a disaster-prone country exposed to recurrent volcanic activity, hurricanes, and landslides. In 1976, for example, an earthquake caused 23,000 fatalities and resulted in economic damage equal to 18 percent of GDP.Source: Sylvana Ricciarini, American Association for Laboratory Accreditation.
