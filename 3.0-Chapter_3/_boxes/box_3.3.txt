Nepal Society for Earthquake Technology and the Nepal Building CodeThe devastating impact of the April and May 2015 earthquakes in Nepal provided an early test of an innovative approach to building code implementation. The NSET has carried out a multifaceted program of earthquake risk reduction over the past 20 years, and its initiatives have included building code development, mason training, school retrofit, and regulatory capacity building.Developed in 1994, the Nepal Building Code (NBC) addresses the full range of locally prevalent construction types, including non-engineered indigenous structures.  Most buildings in Nepal are built by owner-builders or local tradesmen. Neither group is trained in seismic construction. In the absence of basic regulatory capacity, the Nepalese code development team chose to set realistic objectives for the design of technical standards and guidance materials. For simple, small-scale construction, the code proposed technical guidance as “rules of thumb,” assuming that simple but essential structural details could be checked by nonspecialist staff of municipal building departments. The NBC recognized the full spectrum of current forms of construction through a four-tier building permitting system. On this basis, it developed a hierarchy of building controls consistent with the existing capacity on the ground in terms of both construction practice and regulatory application of compliance checks. **International state-of-the-art construction**:                                                                                                                 There are occasional examples of such construction, including high-rise hotels and office buildings, in the country. If consultants ensure that their designs meet recognized international standards, the designs are considered to be in conformance with NBC.**Professionally engineered structures**:                                                                                                                           These include all usual structures such as hospitals, commercial buildings, factories, warehouses, and multistory buildings. For such buildings, design requirements are provided in the NBC.**Small buildings designed to meet “rules of thumb**”:                                                                                                  This category is defined as buildings constructed with modern materials, such as concrete and steel, but not exceeding simple criteria of height, configuration, and number of stories or floor area. Mandatory rules of thumb are provided. The requirements are typically confined to the maximum span, minimum reinforcing and member sizes, positioning of earthquake-resisting elements, and other such rules. The guidance materials are provided in a form that an experienced construction manager or mason can understand while presenting sufficient detail to pass the permit review of the building department.**Non-engineered construction employing traditional materials and skills**:                                                These guidelines are based on the analysis of some 50 typical prevailing building types in Nepal constructed by employing vernacular materials and skills. Two sets of guidelines have been developed, one dealing with low-strength masonry and another dealing with earthen structures. The guidelines provide simple rules for improving seismic safety of these structures. Although these recommendations are described as guidelines, they are intended as mandatory for structures built in areas controlled by a building permit–issuing local authority.Sources: Parajuli et al. 2000; UNCRD 2008.
