Case study: Post-earthquake reconstruction in Central Java, Indonesia **An opportunity for future disaster risk reduction**On May 27, 2006, an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 hit the south coast of Java. The earthquake caused more than 5,000 fatalities, primarily due to building collapse. It destroyed 154,000 houses and caused 260,000 others structural damage. As in other developing countries, houses in the villages of Central Java were typically constructed by nonprofessional owner-builders or village laborers. Damage to traditional wooden structures was limited. In contrast, unreinforced masonry and nonductile concrete-frame buildings, which utilized nontraditional materials and building practices, suffered severe damage. Soon after the disaster, the local government defined key principles for housing reconstruction in the affected region. These principles included recommendations for structural safety in housing reconstruction and provided direct cash transfers to residents for reconstruction. The cash transfer was made in three tranches conditioned on passing inspection at the three stages of the construction process. Residents were allowed to rebuild themselves or to make use of contractors.As part of the post-earthquake reconstruction program, JICA provided assistance through the local government building code administration system. One of JICA’s major contributions, made in partnership with Gadjah Mada University, was to develop “Key Requirements,” which consisted of a package of simple technical guidance applicable for small one-story houses. The objective of the Key Requirements was to provide specific, simplified technical guidance on critical structural elements that contribute to greater resilience in traditional non-engineered construction. Shortly after the Key Requirements were developed, compliance with them became a requirement for the government cash transfer program. JICA supported the provincial government in extending training on the Key Requirements to the staff of building departments of 17 districts. The initiative used the existing formal building administration and permitting process to introduce marginal improvement to the quality and resilience of traditional non-engineered housing. This targeted and temporary effort was tied to the post-earthquake reconstruction program in Central Java. This intervention has contributed the basis for a potentially permanent increase in quality and safety management for housing in the region.**Results and lessons learned**In the end, nearly 330,000 houses were reconstructed under the reconstruction fund and subsequently benefitted from the improved quality control mechanisms for previously non-engineered houses. Building on this success, the Ministry of Public Works at the national level encouraged local governments to adopt similar mechanisms to improve the resilience of non-engineered housing and extend the benefits of the reconstruction program more broadly.  JICA was invited to extend this intervention to additional districts (Kabupaten) and cities (Kota) in West Sumatra, North Sulawesi, and North Sumatra Provinces over the following six years. At the national level, JICA assisted the Ministry of Public Works in developing standard models of ordinance for provincial governments based on the Key Requirements. To broaden and sustain the benefit of this regulatory advance, JICA also implemented outreach training programs on building control for community and local government officials. The program in Central Java demonstrates how an existing regulatory system can be utilized to improve traditional forms of non-engineered housing: by using the formal permitting process to introduce key engineering concepts like structural resistance, the program reduced risks in a traditionally vulnerable building type. This experience also shows that established building departments can improve the quality and resilience of non-engineered structures through education, guidance, and compliance support, rather than relying solely on coercive enforcement.To reduce losses in future disasters, the most important challenge is to ensure that the process for technical support and inspection can be institutionalized and sustained over the longer term. This will take time and a continuous effort that should be part of a broader disaster risk strategy rather than confined to short-term disaster recovery programs. This process requires commitment in sustainable financial resources and human capacity improvement, and will involve various actors such as national and local governments, community-based organizations (CBOs), universities, and the private sector, including the building sector. Source: Dr. Tatsuo Narafu, JICA; Keiko Sakoda Kaneda, World Bank.
