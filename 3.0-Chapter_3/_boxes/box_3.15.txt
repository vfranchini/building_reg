How the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) makes information on hazard available to the public

One mission of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is to develop and apply hazard science to help protect the safety and security of the U.S. The costs and consequences of natural hazards can be quite significant, and each year more people and infrastructure are at risk. USGS scientific research can help to explain and reduce natural hazard risks by effectively communicating reliable information about hazard characteristics, such as frequency, magnitude, extent, onset, consequences, and, where possible, the time of future events.
To accomplish its broad hazard mission, the USGS maintains an expert workforce of scientists and technicians in hydrology, biology, and geography, as well as earth, social, and behavioral sciences and other fields. It engages cooperatively with numerous agencies, research institutions, and organizations in the public and private sectors across the U.S. and around the world. 
Science provides the information that decision makers need to determine whether risk management activities are worthwhile. Moreover, as the agency with the perspective of geologic time, the USGS is uniquely positioned to broaden society’s perspective with information about events outside current memory – and in this way prepare society for similar events. The USGS has critical statutory and nonstatutory roles regarding floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, coastal erosion, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and magnetic storms.
USGS produces and disseminates maps and other public information on the above-listed natural hazards to guide public and private decision making regarding disaster risk and risk reduction measures. These resources are made available to the public in a range of formats including digital.
