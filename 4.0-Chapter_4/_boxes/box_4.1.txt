What is the __Doing Business__ report?One of the farthest-reaching efforts to measure regulations was initiated by the __Doing Business__ report in 2005. An annual World Bank Group publication with a powerful global media campaign, __Doing Business__ provides objective measures of business regulations in 189 economies and selected cities at the national and subnational level. The report creates a ranking for each country and spotlights “reforms” and new “best practices.” Its release is frequently accompanied by a spirited debate among its staunch supporters and opponents.In the past 10 years, the report has measured the ease of “dealing with construction permits” and counted a total of 170 related reforms across the globe.  Most of these reforms were actually catalyzed by __Doing Business__, which builds upon the visibility and competitive pressure surrounding its publication.Since its inception, __Doing Business__ has ignited a new focus on building code implementation. The report puts pressure on governments to remove costly inefficiencies, thus shifting the attention to downstream implementation issues of building codes, with a focus on building permits procedures and municipal inspections. In terms of success and extent of usage, no other instrument has done as much to encourage political leaders and regulators in developing countries to improve their construction standards, simplify procedures, and reduce compliance costs.The “dealing with construction permits” indicator will be expanded in __Doing Business 2016__ to include an index measuring good practices in construction regulation.  This volume will also assess the quality control and safety mechanisms in place for construction permitting systems, as well as the quality of building regulations. Data on these new criteria were collected for 170 countries in a trial phase in 2014.
