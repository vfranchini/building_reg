## Program strategic goal
The strategic goal of the program is to reduce human and economic losses by limiting the creation of new risks and reducing existing risks in the built environments of low- and middle-income countries. By implementing building regulation and supporting active compliance, the program will accelerate the application of current scientific and engineering understanding to a safer built environment. 

The program will provide technical assistance and support targeted investment activities with a focus on strengthening implementation capacity at the municipal level.
The program will be structured around four components:
1.  Developing national level legislation and institutions
2.  Developing, updating, and maintaining building codes 
3.  Investing in local regulatory implementation and compliance support 
4.  Maintaining strong support for regulatory reform at the international level through knowledge sharing, communications, and measurement of results 
A brief description of the program components is provided in Section 4.3.  Based on local circumstances, each component will focus on implementing a relevant subset of the recommendations developed in Chapter 3.
The specific recommendations under each component serve as the basis to establish a generic work program. It is anticipated that each cluster of recommendations will be modified to create a locally applicable work program that will fit the particular development needs of the national or local intervention.
