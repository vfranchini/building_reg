## Measuring progress
In line with the __Sendai Framework for Action__ agenda, the program will carry out baseline surveys and develop indicators that will serve as the basis for targets—both qualitative and quantitative—for reducing chronic and disaster risk in the built environment.
Reducing risk depends upon the complex interaction of several variables. Direct investment in improved regulatory capacity in building departments at the municipal level, such as inspector training, must be accompanied by improvements in building professional training, materials certification, construction finance, and insurance. 
The measurement of regulatory outcomes related to reducing disaster losses is complicated by the estimation of expected losses and the dynamics of future hazard exposure. Therefore, the program will, in the near term, focus on measuring outputs and outcomes directly related to the contribution of regulatory implementation to code compliance and evidence of safer construction:
+ .The development of an enabling policy and legislative framework for effective building code regimes. This can be measured by an inventory and evaluation of legislation and policies designed to enhance building codes and code compliance.
+ .The establishment of institutional capacity for the implementation of legislation, building codes, and standards. The program will rely on outcome indicators reflecting the actual compliance with code provisions. Verification of compliance may be confirmed by third-party checks of plan reviews and site inspections.
The program plans to use a set of core indicators to measure the impacts of the program’s intervention (Figure 4.3). 
It should be noted that the question of how to evaluate code compliance in finished buildings is not simple. First, key aspects of construction, such as rebar spacing, are not available for reinspection. Second, the cost of reinspection can be very significant. To minimize such costs, the program will use rapid visual screening (RVS) and statistical sampling. In the case of existing buildings, RVS surveys will be based on three parameters, exposure, vulnerability, and occupancy. The RVS is an evaluation procedure developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the late 1980s to identify, inventory, and screen buildings that are potentially seismically hazardous.<sup>114</sup> 
These indicators would serve as a starting point for measurement: the final selection of indicators would need to be well-tailored to the specific objectives and scope of country-level interventions. Experience has shown that indicators are most successful when developed by those who will use them to guide decision making. Given the relation of risk reduction to many social, economic, and development objectives, the program will ensure that measurement activities are developed in a participatory manner that encourages a broad ownership and maximizes commitments to reforms.
### Measuring interim accomplishments
In order to set baselines and targets, define reform priorities, and measure progress on interim accomplishments, the program will make use of at least two sets of data:
+ .__Doing Business__’s annual survey referencing construction permit indicators would provide measurement on general aspects of building regulatory administrative efficiency (Box 4.1). The same survey is now being extended to include indictors that reflect the influence of local building code implementation on actual risk reduction in buildings. Starting in 2016, the report will present an additional index assigning higher scores to jurisdictions with more practices such as third-party verifications, final inspections of buildings, and qualifications requirements for engineers.
+ .An evaluation and benchmarking methodology will be developed to capture more detailed building regulatory processes and effectiveness indicators.  This will make it possible to assess more comprehensively the contribution of building code implementation to actual disaster risk reduction and resilience.
